# [[PFMIG]] - Rings

Rings bestow magical powers upon their wearers. Only a rare few have chargesâ€”most magic rings are permanent and potent magic items. Anyone can use a ring.

A character can only effectively wear two magic rings. A third magic ring doesnâ€™t work if the wearer is already wearing two magic rings.

**Physical Description**: Rings have no appreciable weight. Although exceptions exist that are crafted from glass or bone, the vast majority of rings are forged from metalâ€”usually precious metals such as gold, silver, and platinum. A ring has [AC](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class) 13, 2 hit points, hardness 10, and a break DC of 25.

**Activation**: A ringâ€™s ability is usually activated by a spoken [command word](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items#TOC-Command-Word) (a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity) or its effects work continually. Some rings have unusual activations, as mentioned in the ringâ€™s specific description.
