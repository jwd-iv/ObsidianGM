# [[PFSG]] - Conflict

With age come the events and relationships that leave a definitive mark on your personality. You face and resolve moral challenges, your romantic relationships blossom and sometimes wilt, you meet those who become adventuring companions, and you face your [vulnerabilities](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Vulnerabilities-Ex-or-Su-) either in the form of personal challenges or adversaries who represent some side of yourself.

If you can play any alignment, roll [[PFSG-Conflict#^Motivation-Any]]. If your campaign allows only nonevil characters, roll [[PFSG-Conflict#^Conflicts-Nonevil]]. If you are playing a character who must be good, roll [[PFSG-Conflict#^Conflicts-Good]]. Once you are done, proceed to **Table: Conflict Subject** and to the tables and sections subsequent to it.

| 01â€“60    | *Gentry*â€”a minor lord, lady, or noble with an income, hereditary land such as a manor, and titles; paid tribute by peasants. They serve a higher baron, count, or duke.                                                                                           |
| 61â€“78    | *Knight*â€”a noble with estates, titles, and lands who serves a lord. They have sworn an oath of fealty to a liegeâ€”such as a baron, count, or dukeâ€”and commit to military service in their name.                                                                    |
| 79â€“85    | *Baron/Baroness*â€”a noble responsible for a land encompassing several smaller manors that pay tribute. They receive orders directly from the monarch, and are expected to attend the royal court.                                                                  |
| 86â€“91    | *Count/Countess*â€”among the most wealthy nobles in your domain, with hereditary titles, land, and estates. Knights and minor lords pay them tribute, and they attend directly to the monarch and the royal court.                                                  |
| 92â€“96    | *Duke/Duchess*â€”the most powerful noble in the realm apart from the royal family. They attend directly to the monarch and have the highest place at court. Their lands, titles, and estates are significant, and many lords and knights serve under their command. |
| 97â€“99    | *Minor Prince/Princess*â€”part of the royal family. Not the next in succession, but their power and wealth are grand indeed.                                                                                                                                        |
| 100      | *Regent*â€”the son or daughter of the monarch. They owe fealty directly to the rule, and no one else. Few command the power and wealth they do, and their presence inspires great respect, if not total awe, among those who kneel before the crown.                |

#### Resolution

Once you determine the nature and CP for the event, the next step is to determine the resolution. Instead of rolling for the conflictâ€™s resolution, you choose how you dealt with it, and your choice can affect the number of CP the conflict is worth. In games that do not allow evil characters, you cannot take a resolution that would adjust your character to an evil alignment.

Or you can roll: `dice: [[PFSG-Conflict#^Conflict-Resolution]]`

| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | *Regret and Penance [CP:: -3]*â€”Not only do you regret your action, but you have publicly admitted to it and did your best to make amends for the wrongdoing. Most know of the conflictâ€™s details and those who donâ€™t can easily find them out if they know where to look or whom to ask.                                         |
| 2        | *Sincere Regret [CP:: -2]*â€”Though you feel sincere regret for the event and its memory affects your behavior, itâ€™s still a secret. Only your trusted companions know of the conflict, and they have promised a degree of discretion.                                                                                             |
| 3        | *Secret Regret [CP:: -1]*â€”You regret the conflict, but go to great lengths to keep it secret and try desperately to forget it ever happened. Only you and maybe a select few people know of your involvement in the conflict.                                                                                                    |
| 4        | *Mixed Feelings [CP:: 0]*â€”Sometimes you regret the conflict, but other times you feel as if you didnâ€™t have a choice in the matter or that you made the right decision. Most of the time, you just avoid thinking about the conflict. Only you and maybe a select few people know of your involvement.                           |
| 5        | *Denial [CP:: 1]*â€”You feel little if any regret, and deny the event mostly so others wonâ€™t judge you. Few if any know of your part in the conflict, and your constant denials are meant to keep it that way.                                                                                                                     |
| 6        | *No Guilt [CP:: 2]*â€”Either guilt is for the weak, or you know you made the right decision. You might not openly brag about your part in the conflict, but you donâ€™t deny it when confronted either.                                                                                                                              |
| 7        | *You Enjoyed It [CP:: 3]*â€”Those who cling to petty morals have no understanding of what true freedom and power is. The fact is, you enjoyed your part in the conflict and would do it all over again if the opportunity presented itself. Many people know of your misdeed, and they also realize your complete lack of remorse. |
