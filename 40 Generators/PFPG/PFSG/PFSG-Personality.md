### Deity and Religious Philosophy

Once you have determined your alignment, choose a deity or religious philosophy. Association with a specific deity gives you access to a related religion trait. Even if you are not interested in your character being associated with a deity, you can choose “No Deity” or “Undecided” granting you access to abilities outside the realm of faith.

> **No Deity** Even in a world filled with the powers of the divine, you have decided to follow reason, put your faith in the potential of mortals, or otherwise invest in the ways of the material world instead of embracing the teachings of deities. Enables (social trait:: Tireless Logic).
> 
> **Undecided** You have remained undecided when it comes to your faith, but are accepting of others’ faiths and are at least somewhat open to the idea of joining an organized faith should you find one that strikes your fancy. Enables (faith trait:: Ease of Faith).
