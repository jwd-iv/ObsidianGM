# PF Background Generator

uses:: [[PF Ultimate Campaign.pdf]], [PFSRD](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/more-character-options/character-backgrounds/background-generator)

part of:: [[Pathfinder procgen]]

next:: [[PFCG]]

The background generator is intended to remove the creative pressure that can sometimes frustrate players as they try to flesh out the murky details of their characters' backgrounds. This generator provides these details with either a simple roll of the die or the players deliberately selecting from options on the furnished tables and lists. Think of each element on the background generator's tables as a piece of story material that you can link together with other random pieces to create a story you otherwise might now have imagined. Use this tool to inspire creativity rather than as hard-and-fast rules to mandate rigid and seamless character backgrounds. Though the generator provides many foundational details of a character's background, it takes some creative thought to massage the specifics together. As you use the generator, feel free at any point to reject or reroll contradictory elements or ones that go against your vision of the emerging character. Like the background questions presented earlier in this chapter, the ideas on these tables are simply suggestions designed to channel and focus your imagination.

While rolling on the tables in these three steps, you are sometimes granted access to a trait, story feat, or drawback. Upon gaining access to one of these rules elements, write it down. At the end of background generation, you can choose up to two of the traits you've gained access to. If you gained access to at least one drawback, you can take one of those drawbacks to gain an additional trait you have access to (following the normal rules for trait selection). When you gain access to a story feat, it means you've met the prerequisite for the feat and can take it at any time, not just at character creation.

The tables below determine the basics of your family and homeland. These establish the circumstances of your upbringing, the composition of your family, and your family's social standing, as well as a major event you experienced in childhood.

### Unusual Homeland

You grew up in a region not typically associated with the lands that your people call home. If the result is one that is typical for your race, this region is one where there are few other members of your race, outside of your family.
