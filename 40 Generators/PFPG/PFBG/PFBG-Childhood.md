| 21â€“25    | *Death in the Family*â€”You were profoundly affected by the death of the relative closest to youâ€”a parent, grandparent, favorite sibling, aunt, uncle, or cousin. This death affected you profoundly, and you've never been able to let go of it. Enables (combat trait:: Reactionary), (story feat:: Deny the Reaper).                                                                                                                                         |
| 26â€“30    | *Died*â€”You died, or came so close to death that you walked the boundary between the realms of the living and the dead. Having passed from life's domain once, you have a unique perspective on life, perhaps even a greater appreciation for itâ€”or maybe your experience caused you to reject all trivial things, focusing only on matters of true import. Enables (faith trait:: Fearless Defiance), (story feat:: Arisen).                                  |
| 31â€“35    | *Fall of a Major Power*â€”In your early years, an old power with far-reaching influence fell into decline. This could have been an empire, a major organization or gang, or a person such as a benevolent king or evil dictator. Your early memories were founded in a world where this great power affected your region for good or ill. Enables (social trait:: Worldly).                                                                                     |
| 36â€“40    | *Fell in with a Bad Crowd*â€”In your youth, you ran with a brutal, evil, or sadistic crowd. You might have belonged to a gang, a thieves' guild, or some other nefarious organization. It was easy to cave in to pressure and do whatever they told you to do, and your outlook is colored by moral ambiguity. Enables (social trait:: Child of the Streets).                                                                                                   |
| 41â€“45    | *First Kill*â€”You've had blood on your hands since your youth, when you first took the life of another creature. Whether this act repulsed you or gave you pleasure, it was a formative experience. Enables (combat trait:: Killer), (story feat:: Innocent Blood).                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 46â€“50    | *Troubled First Love*â€”Your first love was everything you imagined it would be. That is, until you were separated from your beloved. This may have been the result of distance, changing perspectives, death, or differences in class or family. Some have said this made you jadedâ€”you think it has granted you insight on how the world really works. Enables (social trait:: Worldly) and you roll a d12 instead of a d20 on Table: Romantic Relationships. |
| 51â€“55    | *Imprisoned*â€”Your criminal record began when you were young, when you were `dice: [[PFSG-Crime#^Punishment]]` for `dice: [[PFSG-Crime#^Crime]]`.

Enables (social trait:: Criminal), (story feat:: Liberator).                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 56â€“60    | *Inheritance*â€”A great sum of wealth or property was bequeathed to you at an early age, providing you with extraordinary means. Daily costs of living have ceased to concern you, and youâ€™ve learned that there is little that money cannot buy. Enables (social trait:: Rich Parents).                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 61â€“65    | *Kidnapped*â€”You were kidnapped at some point in your childhood.

Before you were released, were ransomed, or escaped, you picked up on various aspects of the criminal underworld. Enables (social trait:: Canter), (story feat:: Liberator).                                                         |
| 66â€“70    | *Magical Gift*â€”When you were a child, you found, stole, or were given a magic item that gave you an extraordinary ability. You may have used this item for mischief, crime, or good. Since that time, magic items have always held a special fascination for you. Enables (magic trait:: Magical Talent).                                                                                                                                                     |
| 71â€“75    | *Major Disaster*â€”You witnessedâ€”and survivedâ€”a major disaster in your childhood years, such as a great fire, flood, earthquake, volcano, or storm.

| 76â€“80    | *Mentorship/Patronage*â€”a mentor or patron took an interest in your development and volunteered to train or sponsor you. This creatureâ€™s motives might not be entirely clear, but without its influence you would not be who you are. Enables (social trait:: Mentored).                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 81â€“85    | *Met a Fantastic Creature*â€”When you were only a child, you made contact with a magical creature, such as a dragon, unicorn, genie, pixie, or similar creature. You learned a powerful lesson or a magic trick from that creature. This meeting changed your life and made you different from the other children. Enables (magic trait:: Gifted Adept).                                                                                                        |
| 86â€“90    | *Ordinary Childhood*â€”Your childhood was fairly ordinary, with no major blessing or catastropheâ€”a stark contrast to an adventuring life. You lived your life in anticipation of growing up so you could affect the dull backdrop upon which your mundane life was painted. Now that youâ€™ve grown, itâ€™s easy to miss those tranquil days where nothing ever seemed to happen. Enables (social trait:: Ordinary).                                                |

Enables (combat trait:: Axe to Grind), (story feat:: Foeslayer), (story feat:: Vengeance).                                                                                     |
| 96-100   | *The War*â€”You grew up against the backdrop of a major military conflict that affected much of your childhood world. You became accustomed to a short food supply, living in occupied territory, and moving from place to place. Several of the people you knew in your childhood were lost in the war, including members of your family. Enables (regional trait:: Vagabond Child), (story feat:: Deny the Reaper).                                           |
