# PFCG-Summoner

Most, if not all, spellcasters can call to otherworldly creatures for aid. and though many learn to call increasingly powerful minions to assist them, none boast the same connection to these [outsiders](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider) as [summoners](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/summoner) do. a [summoner](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/summoner) is defined by the bond formed with the single creature that acts as his [eidolon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/summoner#TOC-Eidolon). Protectors, steeds, and links to other worlds, eidolons are lifelong companions for their mortal masters. The choice to tie oneself to an [eidolon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/summoner#TOC-Eidolon) and the circumstances leading to that choice form the foundation of any [summoner](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/summoner)â€˜s character. Roll on **Table: Summoner Backgrounds** to determine what caused you to forge your otherworldly bond with your trusted companion.

| 01â€“10     | *Abandoned*â€”At some point early on, you were abandoned. This sense of loss always made you feel as though something were missing. The discovery of your [eidolon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/summoner#TOC-Eidolon) and your subsequent mutual bond fostered in you the sense of companionship youâ€™ve always longed for. [magic trait:: Greater Link]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 11â€“20     | *Caretaker*â€”You met your [eidolon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/summoner#TOC-Eidolon) or another [outsider](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider) in a moment of danger. Wounded or lost, the creature crashed between worlds and ended up at your feet. In helping this [panicked](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Panicked), otherworldly creature, you felt a link to it. You can still draw on the inspiration from that moment when dealing with others, [outsider](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider) or not. [social trait:: Destined Diplomat]                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 21â€“30     | *Forced to Confront Your Own Limits*â€”The bond with your [eidolon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/summoner#TOC-Eidolon) first manifested when you saw someone in danger and were unable to help. Your feeling of desperation and frustration at the limits of your own form attracted your [eidolon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/summoner#TOC-Eidolon)â€”whether or not it was able to help you in that moment. This need to exceed your own limitations continues to manifest in the evolution of your [eidolon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/summoner#TOC-Eidolon). [magic trait:: Desperate Speed]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 31â€“40     | *Imaginary Friends*â€”As a child, you created imaginary playmates that you felt truly spoke to and heard you. These whispers were actually the wandering thoughts of [outsiders](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider) trying to make contact, knowing that someday you would have an affinity with their kind. By the time you learned to [summon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Summon-Sp-) your [eidolon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/summoner#TOC-Eidolon) and other [outsiders](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider), these whispered fragments had turned themselves into an understanding of the language of [outsiders](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider). [social trait:: Unintentional Linguist] |
| 41â€“50     | *Monophobic*â€”You were always terrified of being alone when you were younger, so you surrounded yourself with others. But it was establishing this link to your [eidolon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/summoner#TOC-Eidolon) that ultimately allowed you to overcome this debilitating fear. Now, even when your [eidolon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/summoner#TOC-Eidolon) is not with you, you know itâ€™s never far away; conversely, when you have your true friend and companion with you, you are far better for it. [faith trait:: Perpetual Companion]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 51â€“60     | *Outsiderâ€™s Lineage*â€”You have the blood of [outsiders](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider) in your veins. This lineage either laid dormant until your powers manifested or was a storied part of your family heritage. Regardless, your connection to the planes has always been potent. No matter what other subjects you studied, your understanding of planar matters has always seemed instinctive or innate rather than the product of memorization and study. [faith trait:: Planar Savant]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 61â€“70     | *Pick On Someone Your Own Size*â€”When you were young, you or others you cared for were bullied by agents of an oppressive power. At some point, you stood up against one or many of the tyrants, feeling that somehow you were bigger, stronger and more resilient than you actually were. You later realized that this support was the first trace of your [eidolon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/summoner#TOC-Eidolon) trying to make contact with you. You can still draw on that power today, making your aura strong and your presence powerful. [magic trait:: Twinned Presence]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 71â€“80     | *Raising Gone Wrong*â€”You lost someone important to you. Through means, luck, or simple pity, you had the chance to raise that person from the [dead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead), but something went wrong with the spell and the raising did not occurâ€¦ at least not as planned. Your lost friend or kinâ€™s soul bonded with a powerful [outsider](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider) on the other side of the veil and returned to you as your [eidolon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/summoner#TOC-Eidolon). Possessed of some of the memories and experiences of the life you spent together, your companion feels a stronger devotion than even most others of its kind. [faith trait:: Loyalty across Lifetimes]                                                                                              |
| 81â€“90     | *Saved by Another*â€”Someone or something saved you from great danger. It might have been a family member who saved you from a precipitous fall or adventurers who saved you from a marauding monster. Your sense of gratitude fostered a strong sense of protectiveness, particularly when defending your allies or your [eidolon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/summoner#TOC-Eidolon). [combat trait:: Dedicated Defender]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 91â€“100    | *Stranger in Your Own Skin*â€”You have felt awkward and uncomfortable your entire life, as if you were born into a body that wasnâ€™t truly yours. Your quest to become what youâ€™ve always felt you should be led you to your [eidolon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/summoner#TOC-Eidolon), in which you found what you see as your own idealized form. The link that you and your [eidolon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/summoner#TOC-Eidolon) share allows you to escape some of the inherent limits of your form from time to time. [magic trait:: Linked Surge]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
