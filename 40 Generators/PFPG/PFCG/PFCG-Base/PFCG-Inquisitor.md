# PFCG-Inquisitor

Bolstering the ranks of both good and evil deities, [inquisitors](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/inquisitor) draw their power from unwavering convictions to the causes of their gods. Unlike [clerics](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric) and [oracles](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/oracle), however, [inquisitors](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/inquisitor) are less interested in the theological and metaphysical aspects of faith and belief than what they consider to be the harsh realities of defending that faith. Roll on **Table: Inquisitor Backgrounds** to determine what event made you temper your faith with stern judgment.

| --------- |:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 01–10     | *Bureaucracy’s Bane*—You chose the [inquisitor](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/inquisitor)‘s path because you have no taste for the petty rules and regulations that mire the leaders of your faith in inaction and inefficacy. You know that you are an instrument of your deity and that your directives do not require intercession by the less motivated. [faith trait:: Focused Disciple]                                                                                     |
| 11–20     | *Chaplain*—You learned long ago that in the heat of battle and under the pall of war, even the most devout can waiver in faith. You subsequently dedicated yourself to stewarding the faith of soldiers and allies in times of great conflict. [combat trait:: Battlefield Disciple] [story feat:: Battlefield Healer]                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 21–30     | *Exemplar*—You found early on that you lacked the logic or the vocabulary to communicate the virtues of faith—more precisely, your faith—to others. You decided that the best way to foster respect and appreciation for your god was not with words, but with action. [faith trait:: Beacon of Faith]                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 31–40     | *Failed Cleric*—Your original training in divine magic was as a [cleric](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric), but your faith eventually distilled into you the ability to hear lies and see weaknesses in the “unfaithful.” [faith trait:: Schooled Inquisitor]                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 41–50     | *Faith-Bringer*—You know that in order to bring the light of your deity to others, you must traverse hostile territories and face even more hostile inhabitants. [social trait:: Weathered Emissary] [story feat:: Fearless Zeal]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 51–60     | *False Witness*—You’ve seen innocent people suffer due to another’s lies. While these injustices made you feel powerless, they’ve also kindled a desire in you to punish those who regard truth so cheaply. [combat trait:: Vigilant Battler]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 61–70     | *Few Left to Safeguard the Faith*—You are the vanguard of your faith. Perhaps you are a pilgrim for a good deity in an unholy land, or the secret enforcer of a sect that operates in the shadows of the world. You are accustomed to working alone and with little guidance from the superiors of your church, trusting your own moral judgment to act on behalf of your god. This certainty acts as a defense against the magic of other, “lesser” deities. [faith trait:: Disdainful Defender] |
| 71–80     | *Temple Detective*—Your ability to sniff out falsehood and see weakness in others made you uniquely suited to guard the religious houses of your order. [social trait:: Truth’s Agent]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 81–90     | *The Path of Righteous Rage*—Your faith does not manifest in calm prayer or serene meditation. You achieve the transcendent feeling of the divine when you are in the throes of battle for your deity. [combat trait:: Indelible Ire]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 91–100    | *Zealot*—Your devotion is fanatical and your powers are clearly proof of your connection with the divine. Although you know that other gods bestow similar powers upon their own disciples, you either revile or pity those of “lesser” faiths. [faith trait:: Zealous Striker]                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
