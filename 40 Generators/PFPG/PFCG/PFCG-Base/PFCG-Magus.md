| 01â€“10     | *A Mage without Magic*â€”Early in your arcane training, you were exposed to antimagic. The powerlessness you felt from all of your magic being stripped away left you feeling desperate and helpless. You vowed to never be that [helpless](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless) child again, to be strong in such moments, putting you on the path of the [magus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/magus). [combat trait:: Dispelled Battler]                                                                                                           |
| 11â€“20     | *Conflicting Legacy*â€”You were born to a family or clan with two great pedigrees: one of magic and one of battle. Unable to choose either path for fear of alienating a mentor or parent, you sought to master both. Your dedication to the blending of martial and magical has been so intense that your martial prowess feeds your arcane power. [magic trait:: Arcane Revitalization]                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 21â€“30     | *Ready for Anything*â€”For you, the path of the [magus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/magus) is not about the fluid blend of disparate fields of study or conquering an insurmountable challenge, but the art of preparation for any obstacle that comes your way. a dedicated and logical person, you hone the [magus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/magus) affinity for operating all manner of magical devices from blind luck to a refined procedure. [magic trait:: Pragmatic Activator]                                                                        |
| 31â€“40     | *Lost Teacher*â€”Your [magus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/magus) training was interrupted when you lost your teacher through the displacement of your family, lack of funds to continue schooling, or the teacherâ€™s unexpected death. Despite this hardship, the time you spent with your mentor had already sown the seeds of your training and youâ€™ve been able to continue on your own in the time sinceâ€”ceaselessly seeking, reading, and learning from any magical text you can find. [magic trait:: Self-Taught Scholar]                                                    |
| 41â€“50     | *Promise*â€”Your dreams of becoming a [wizard](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard) were cut short by unfortunate circumstances, such as the death of your family or clanâ€™s matriarch or patriarch, hostile invading forces, conscription in the army, and so on. This forced you to become a protector and stunted the growth of your studies. Though you have successfully blended the two disciplines, you still long for the unfulfilled potential of your career as a [wizard](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard). [magic trait:: Cross-Disciplined] |
| 51â€“60     | *Shameful Secret*â€”You come from either a proud military and martial background or a legacy of skilled wizards. When you developed an aptitude for two different powers viewed as incompatible by your family or teachers, it drove you to hide half of your abilities and to pretend full-blown competency with the other. Some of the tricks you used to perpetrate this deception have stayed with you to this day. [magic trait:: Partial Protege]                                                                                     |
| 61â€“70     | *Spell Backfire*â€”At some point during your magical training, you attempted to cast a spell and failed. But rather than being wasted, the arcane energy reabsorbed itself into your body, waiting to be reused in some other way. When the arcane energy exploded outward through your staff or some other instrument you wielded, you received your first glimpse of the ways that magic could be repurposedâ€”a versatility you retain today. [magic trait:: Malleable Magic]                                                                                                                   |
| 71â€“80     | *Spellâ€™s Edge*â€”The first time you held a magic weapon and felt the thrum of arcane energy within, you knew that magic and melee were meant to be joined. Since that moment, magic weaponry has become symbolic of the most potent syntheses of your [magus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/magus) training, and your ability to create magical weapons and imbue mundane arms with magic still resonates with this focus. [magic trait:: Bladed Magic]                                                                                                                             |
| 81â€“90     | *Vindication*â€”You spent your formative years trying to convince combat instructors of the virtues of magic and arcane mentors of the importance of strength in arms, only to be mocked and exiled from both disciplines. Since then, youâ€™ve wandered from master to master, honing your knowledge of both fields of study to show them all that not only have you achieved power, but youâ€™ve also eclipsed all those who shunned you. [magic trait:: Arcane Temper]                                                                                                                              |
| 91â€“100    | *What If*â€”You donâ€™t know the meaning of impossible. Everyone around you thinks you have your head stuck in the clouds, but you continually strive to achieve things that have never been accomplished beforeâ€”perhaps things that have never even been dreamed of. Bucking convention has brought numerous failures, but youâ€™ve learned from your mistakes and are able to snatch victory over seemingly impossible odds. [faith trait:: Inspired]                                                                                                                                               |
