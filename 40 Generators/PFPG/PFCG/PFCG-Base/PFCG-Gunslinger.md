| 01‚Äì10     | *Any Fool Can Swing a Sword*‚ÄîSometime during your youth, you came to the conclusion that most melee and ranged weapons are crude and primitive compared to firearms. It puzzles you that anyone with martial aptitude deigns to devote their skill to anything other than firearms. You disregard such ‚Äúlesser‚Äù weapons and prefer the feel of your trusty [firearm](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/firearms) over any other tool of war. [combat trait:: Reckless Contempt]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 11‚Äì20     | *Buck Tradition*‚ÄîYou come from a proud tradition of ancient arms and august codes of conduct like those followed by [paladins](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/paladin), [cavaliers](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/cavalier), and [samurai](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/alternate-classes/samurai). Instead of following in the vaunted steps of your predecessors, though, you chose to learn the art of firearms to the shock and perhaps even anger of your family and peers. Your break with tradition fostered in you a nearly insurmountable will that fuels your identity as a [gunslinger](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/gunslinger). [combat trait:: Resolve of the Rejected] |
| 21‚Äì30     | *Custodian of the Future*‚ÄîFirearms are not just an effective implement for killing or a curious mechanical trinket; they are the next step in the technological development of your people. Your passion for the workings of your weapons has you constantly assembling and dismantling firearms to truly understand their mechanics. This ongoing dedication improves your ability to repair firearms and make them deadlier while in your skilled hands. [combat trait:: Unblemished Barrel]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 31‚Äì40     | *Defining Moment*‚ÄîGuns are inexorably linked to a moment where your life dramatically changed. Perhaps you were so sickly as a child that you couldn‚Äôt turn a crossbow‚Äôs winch or bend a bow, but firearms showed you that you could still hunt and fight. Perhaps you picked up a [firearm](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/firearms) in a desperate moment to help a wounded [gunslinger](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/gunslinger) and knew that you had just taken your first step along the same path. a [firearm](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/firearms) at your side instills in you a sense of purpose and destiny that no one can take away. [combat trait:: Black Powder Fortune]        |
| 41‚Äì50     | *Look at What I Can Do*‚ÄîThe lure of something new and showy drove you to first pick up a gun. Although several near mishaps taught you to respect the volatile weapon and the powder that powers it, you still enjoy doing trick shots and getting the oohs and aahs of a crowd. [combat trait:: Black Powder Bravado]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 51‚Äì60     | *Mechanical Savant*‚ÄîFor you, the lure of firearms is not the effect they produce, but the science and mechanical process behind the effect. Your endless tinkering and perfectionism have made your own gun easier to upgrade. [combat trait:: Just Like New]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 61‚Äì70     | *Black Powder Presence*‚ÄîYou grew up belittled and even beaten for not being the biggest or the strongest of your compatriots, family, or race. With no burgeoning aptitude for magic, you looked for some other way to exceed those who found superiority in brute strength‚Äîand you found it in gunslinging. [combat trait:: Larger Than Life]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 71‚Äì80     | *Sacred Charge*‚ÄîYour [gunslinger](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/gunslinger) training is more than just martial skill‚Äîit‚Äôs a calling. Perhaps you are part of an elite group of guards serving and defending a temple or faith. Conversely, you might come from a land where firearms represent the pinnacle of your society‚Äôs advancement or are the last vestige of those who came before. Your sense of higher purpose allows you to fight on and keep firing when winning seems impossible. [combat trait:: Never Stop Shooting]                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 81‚Äì90     | *Shock and Awe*‚ÄîThe sound and fury of gunfire is as potent a weapon as the pellets and bullets your weapon discharges. You live for the reflexive wince that others make when they jump at the sound of a [firearm](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/firearms), and laugh heartily at the amazement you inspire in others with your cacophonous black-powder weapons. [combat trait:: Startling Report]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 91‚Äì100    | *Some Things Are Stronger Than Magic*‚ÄîYou grew up either oppressed by magic cruelly wielded or loathing the elitism of those who possessed such arcane or divine power. Searching for something non-magical that relies on skill and practice led you to the study and wielding of firearms. You relish trumping pompous spellcasters with a quick draw and a keen eye. [combat trait:: Black Powder Interjection]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
