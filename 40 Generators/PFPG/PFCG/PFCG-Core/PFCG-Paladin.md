Champions of virtue and the rule of law, many [paladins](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/paladin) are called to their path at a young age. Some hear the whispers of celestial beings in their minds, while other are drawn down the path of the [paladin](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/paladin) by tragedy and a sincere desire to strike a blow to the evil that stalks the world. Paladins sometimes take on younger charges such as orphans or runaways during their journeys, and the seeds of goodness can be sowed into these impressionable youths to grow another knight on the quest for righteousness. Roll on **Table: Paladin Backgrounds** to determine the formative events that led you to become a [paladin](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/paladin).

| --------- |:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 01â€“10     | *Divine Calling*â€”An otherworldly agent of law and goodâ€”such as an [angel](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Angel), empyreal lord, or perhaps some other celestial envoy of the godsâ€”tasked you to be a divine champion. You accepted the calling (maybe grudgingly) because ultimately you realize that the laws of destiny and oneâ€™s divine calling cannot be denied. In return, that celestial agent watches over you and makes sure you can fully realize your destiny and meet the course that has been set for you by a higher power. [faith trait:: Blessed] |
| 11â€“20     | *Dread Penance*â€”You, or perhaps your family, owe a debt for some past wrongdoing or vice. Maybe you made deals with some unscrupulous loan sharks during a gambling binge or your not-so-distant ancestors were responsible for the persecution of a marginalized group of people. Whatever the offense, your past action hangs over your head and fills you with guilt. Youâ€™ve taken a solemn oath to make good on this past misdeed. Only then will you feel like your life is truly worthwhile. [faith trait:: Oathbound]                                                                              |
| 21â€“30     | *Holy Epiphany*â€”Your faith and purpose came in a brilliant flash of insight. Maybe you suddenly realized that evil can be stopped only with vigilance and deliberate action, or maybe an epiphany showed you that the innocent need protection from corrupt forces for good to flourish in the world. Whatever the nature of your epiphany, it guides your actions and gives you insights others lack. [faith trait:: Inspired]                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 31â€“40     | *Zealous Devotion*â€”Maybe your faith was not popular among those around you during your youth. Maybe you have strange or controversial views regarding your religion, and the other members of your congregation find your practices bizarre or insulting. Whatever the case, your faith is constantly being questioned regardless of your obviously pious nature, and such persecution only serves to embolden your zeal. [faith trait:: Indomitable Faith]                                                                                                                                               |
| 41â€“50     | *Moral Debt*â€”The world and all things material are intrinsically corrupt. All creatures are born with a moral debt, and only by fighting evil, upholding law, and championing the common good can one be truly free of that corruption. You work every day to pay off this debt and move those around you to do the same. [faith trait:: Principled] [story feat:: Fearless Zeal]                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 51â€“60     | *Mark of Faith*â€”Maybe at some point you rebelled against such branding, or it could be youâ€™ve always accepted the mark as an indicator of your destiny. In either case, it was a harbinger of the [paladin](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/paladin) path. [faith trait:: Birthmark]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 61â€“70     | *Righteous Mentor*â€”A [paladin](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/paladin) of note and great honor took you under her wing and taught you many things. She taught you how to adhere to your oath with grace and dignity, and how the simple act of doing so was enough to earn the respect and devotions of others. [social trait:: Natural-Born Leader]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 71â€“80     | *Warrior of Truth*â€”Early in your life, you learned that the philosophies of law and good not only create the best society but also reveal truths that would otherwise remain obscured. You are rarely clouded by pure dogma; instead youâ€™re unafraid to question and create your own path toward truth, justice, and righteousness. [magic trait:: Skeptic]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 81â€“90     | *Knight-Errant*â€”You know that evil stalks the world, and only one who is dedicated to the spread of good can stop these vile forces. To make sure fiends and wrongdoers do not go unpunished, you adopted the code of the [paladin](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/paladin) in order to travel the land and eradicate the wicked. Your goal is the relentless pursuit to seek out evil and put it down. [social trait:: Seeker]                                                                                                                                                               |
| 91â€“100    | *Terrible Secret*â€”You know a terrible secret about an ancient evil that threatens your homeland or perhaps even the entire world. You have sworn to keep this secret quiet lest it gain power in the retelling, but you also must work to thwart the evil whenever possible. This at times contradictory path has led you many places in your travels, and the knowledge you have gleaned from your adventures continues to serve you well in your fight against the wicked. [faith trait:: Scholar of the Great Beyond]                                                                                  |
