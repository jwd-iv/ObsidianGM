Those who become [fighters](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter) take up the sword for many reasons. Some fight for coin, others for duty, and others for survival. Roll on **Table: Fighter Backgrounds** to determine the event that led you to this profession.

| --------- |:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 01â€“10     | *Adventure*â€”Since you can remember, you sought to become a great warrior. Inspired by legends of the past or personal heroes of your civilization, you longed to wield steel and carve your way in the world. [social trait:: Seeker]                                                                                                                                                          |
| 11â€“20     | *Conscripted*â€”You didnâ€™t choose the military life so much as you were drafted into it. You have a non-military background and skill set. Who knows what course your life might have taken had you not been forced to take up arms? [social trait:: Worldly]                                                                                                                                    |
| 21â€“30     | *Duty*â€”You took up the sword because no one else would. When a great danger threatened your home, you stepped forth to meet the challenge, though you were only a youth with just the strength of your arm and steadfastness of your courage to see you through. [combat trait:: Courageous]                                                                                                       |
| 31â€“40     | *Gladiator*â€”As an adolescent, you learned to fight and kill because your master made you, and if you had not learned, you would be dead. Killing was a way of lifeâ€”a means of survival. At first you did it because you had to, but that soon changed when you heard the chorus of the crowd. [combat trait:: Killer], [social trait:: Life of Toil], [story feat:: Champion]           |
| 41â€“50     | *Joined the Watch*â€”Your village, town, city, or tribe needed new recruits for the volunteer watch patrol, and you joined upâ€”whether for money, duty, peace, or power. This rudimentary training gave you an understanding of civilized justice and showed you how to wield a weapon with skill. [regional trait:: Militia Veteran]                                                                 |
| 51â€“60     | *Knighted*â€”Your military path began when you were knighted or made a squire to a knight. Your familyâ€™s status could have influenced this event, or you might be a simple commoner rewarded with a title for a rare feat of courage. As a member of the nobility, you gain access to [social trait:: Influence]                                                                                                    |
| 61â€“70     | *Mercenary*â€”Everyone needs to earn a living, and in your youth you were fast, strong, or tough enough to fight for pay. There are good causes and bad causes, but at the end of the day, it all comes down to money. Sometimes you got easy jobs, like guarding merchant caravans; other times the jobs are rough, like fighting in a rebel lordâ€™s private army. [social trait:: Mercenary] |
| 71â€“80     | *On the Street*â€”You spent adolescence in a seedy part of town. You learned to fight dirty and fight mean. Turns out you were good at it. Your skills drew the interest of gang and guild leaders, tavern keepers, and anyone else who needed hired muscle. [social trait:: Child of the Streets]                                                                                                       |
| 81â€“90     | *Schooled*â€”You learned to fight in a structured environment where you were exposed to a variety of weapons, [armor](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus), strategies, and tactics. You learned to fight as part of a unit, how to follow orders and how to command a squad. [combat trait:: Tactician]                                                    |
| 91â€“100    | *Survival*â€”You spent some part of your life in the wildâ€”in places that abide by the laws of nature rather than those of civilization. You survived by being stronger, faster, and more cunning than the predators. That meant you fought not for coin, honor, or principle, but for your very life. [combat trait:: Resilient]                                                                     |
