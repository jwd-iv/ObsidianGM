# PFCG-Cleric

[Clerics](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric) are not merely people of religious faithâ€”they are devoted servants who wield true divine power from their deities. The particular path that steers a [cleric](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric) toward her faith can mean the difference between a [demon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Demon)\-worshiping cultist and a lawful harbinger of her deityâ€™s blessed faith. The following background events outline some of the ways [clerics](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric) find their faith. Roll on **Table: Cleric Backgrounds** to determine how you came to your faith.

| 01â€“10     | *Angelic Encounter*â€”a supernatural being, such as an [angel](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Angel) or [demon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Demon), appeared to you and proclaimed that you were destined to perform a great task in service to your god. You might have tried to deny itâ€”and you even might still have doubtsâ€”but eventually you took up the mantle of a holy warrior and chose to meet this destiny head on, either to prove to yourself that youâ€™re worthy of such a destiny or to show your supernatural messenger that you cannot be pigeon-holed so easily. [faith trait:: Prophesied] |
| 11â€“20     | *Atonement*â€”In your youth, you committed actions you are not proud of. Your deeds left dark stains upon your soul, ones so deep they might take a lifetime to wash away. When you hit rock-bottomâ€”whether through greed, addiction, hedonism, or simply lack of good senseâ€”you turned to faith, vowing to atone for all of the horrible acts youâ€™ve committed. [faith trait:: Oathbound]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 21â€“30     | *Converted*â€”In your early life, you followed a different faith, a different god or powerful entity, or perhaps no faith at all. a representative of your current faith showed you the error of your ways and converted you, and you couldnâ€™t be happier. You can only hope to do for others what this individual did for you. [faith trait:: Inspired]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 31â€“40     | *Devoted*â€”From your earliest memory, youâ€™ve had a close relationship with your deity. This entity has been a constant presence in your life: your greatest comfort, best companion, truest love, or some combination of the three. Youâ€™ve never had to see or speak with your deity to know that he watches over you, and the beliefs and criticisms of others do not faze youâ€”your faith is enough. [faith trait:: Blessed] [story feat:: Fearless Zeal]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 41â€“50     | *Healed*â€”As a child, you were afflicted with a terrible physical or mental illness or a debilitating wound that prevented you from functioning in society. a miracle worker touched your body and commanded you to be well, andâ€”for perhaps the first time in your lifeâ€”you were whole. Now you live your life in tribute to the deity whose divine healer restored you, and perhaps hope to bestow similar gifts unto deserving nonbelievers. [faith trait:: Sacred Touch] [story feat:: Battlefield Healer]                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 51â€“60     | *Reborn*â€”You died or nearly died. In the midst of this experience, your mind came to a place of quiet where you witnessed your deity or its agents pulling your body and spirit back from the brink of death. Every day since has been a gift, and you strive to understand the reason you have been saved while countless others perish. [bloodline race trait:: Deathtouched] [story feat:: Arisen]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 61â€“70     | *Religious Colony/Settlement*â€”This may have been a small village in the hinterlands or a kingdom-sized theocracy devoted to a single religion. When you came of age, you decided to serve your god and country as a [cleric](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric), a choice that garnered respect, dignity, and honor among your people. [social trait:: Natural-Born Leader]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 71â€“80     | *Revelation*â€”In your youth, a deity granted you visions or dreams that revealed startling truths. These visions might have been prophetic, deeply insightful, or filled with extraordinary solutions to problems that plagued you, your family, or your community. So powerful and compelling were the visions that you devoted your life to the deity. [social trait:: Worldly]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 81â€“90     | *Sanctuary*â€”When you were young, you did (or were accused of) `dice: [[PFSG-Crime#^Crime]]` and fled to the only place that could shelter you being `dice: [[PFSG-Crime#^Punishment]]`. You found sanctuary among the worshipers of a deity, and they took you in and protected you. In time, you joined the faithful to serve their cause in the world, though the shadow of your past sin still lurks beyond the churchâ€™s walls. [social trait:: Criminal]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 91â€“100    | *Taken in by the Church*â€”You spent your youth in a church or monastery serving as an acolyte or doing menial work on the grounds, either taken in as an orphan, sent there by your equally devout parents, or by taking on the faith of your own volition. The traditions and rituals of the religion served as your way of life throughout your adolescence, and you left that pious community with the skills to champion your faith in the world.
