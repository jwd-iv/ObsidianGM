# PFCG-Barbarian

Barbarians are fueled by an almost [supernatural](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-) [rage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/rage) that helps them loose the volatile stores of adrenaline within their bodies. This [rage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian#TOC-Rage-Ex-) stays with the [barbarian](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian) throughout her life as an adventurer, and she learns to refine her fits of passionate anger only over time. Yet each [barbarian‚Äôs](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian) rage is different and personal. It comes from the primal depths of her soul, and cannot be manufactured. Only a select few can channel that purest, deepest [rage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian#TOC-Rage-Ex-) into overpowering combat prowess. Roll on **Table: Barbarian Backgrounds** to determine the event that caused you to first experience your [rage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian#TOC-Rage-Ex-).

| 01‚Äì10     | *Vengeance*‚ÄîWhen you were young, a great wrong was done to you, a loved one, your family, or your people. This experience tore you apart and reduced you to a being of primal emotions. Dreams of vengeance became your only promise of comfort. [combat trait:: Axe to Grind], [story feat:: Foeslayer], [story feat:: Vengeance]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 11‚Äì20     | *Champion of a God*‚ÄîAt your coming-of-age ritual, your deity, totem, or patron spirit sparked your soul with a religious zeal. This entity might be a beast spirit, a warmongering god, a [demon lord](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/demon-lords), or some other supernatural entity. In the name of this otherworldly force you become an unstoppable warrior‚Äîthe bane of all your tribe‚Äôs foes. [faith trait:: Inspired] [story feat:: Champion]                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 21‚Äì30     | *Conquest*‚ÄîUpon coming of age, you went on your first raid, where you learned the thrill of violence and chaos and the satisfaction that came with the spoils of your victory. When your enemies dare to stand against you, your [rage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian#TOC-Rage-Ex-) rekindles until you have conquered and subdued them. [combat trait:: Killer]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 31‚Äì40     | *Hated Foe*‚ÄîIn your formative years, you learned to despise a certain individual, tribe, kingdom, empire, race, or monster due to some slight it inflicted upon you or your people. This foe lurks ever close to your thoughts. So intense is your hatred that the mere thought of this foe can incite your [rage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian#TOC-Rage-Ex-). [combat trait:: Reckless] [story feat:: Foeslayer]                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 41‚Äì50     | *Personal Flaw*‚ÄîThere is a part of yourself that you hate more than anything else. In your adolescence, you first realized this imperfection‚Äîto your lasting shame. This might be a gentle part of yourself you wish to eliminate or a brutal, prideful, greedy, or monstrous side you can‚Äôt control. Your [rage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian#TOC-Rage-Ex-) is fueled by self-loathing, or by projecting this part of yourself onto a foe you wish to destroy. [combat trait:: Axe to Grind]                                                                                                                                                   |
| 51‚Äì60     | *Civilization*‚ÄîWhen you first encountered civilization in your youth, its weak and decadent people revolted you. Once, such people were free and strong, but rules and laws made them feeble. Your [rage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian#TOC-Rage-Ex-) is the wild part‚Äîthe pure part‚Äîof yourself that separates you from the craven ways of ‚Äúcivilized‚Äù people. [social trait:: Savage]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 61‚Äì70     | *Persecution*‚ÄîYou grew up under the persecution of another power‚Äîperhaps a rival tribe, an expansionistic empire, or a tribe of violent monsters. Beaten and bloodied, your people barely survived the onslaught. But the beatings made you strong and taught you how to channel the pain into something useful. Since that time, the flame of rage has burned inside you, waiting to be released against your oppressors. [combat trait:: Bullied]                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 71‚Äì80     | *One of a Dying Breed*‚ÄîYou grew up knowing that your people were slowly dying out‚Äîthat your extinction was inevitable in the face of the changing world. In youthful vigor, you declared that your fire would not be snuffed without a fight. Your [rage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian#TOC-Rage-Ex-) stems from the desperate desire to be remembered, to make a mark upon the world before the sun sets on your dwindling kind. When you [rage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian#TOC-Rage-Ex-), a single thought permeates your burning mind: If you‚Äôre going down, you‚Äôre taking everyone with you. [combat trait:: Reactionary] |
| 81‚Äì90     | *Chaos Embraced*‚ÄîYou grew up in wild lands where there were no laws except for those of nature‚Äîthe laws of the predator and the prey. You searched for meaning in the world, in the gods, in the prayers of priests, in the patterns of the stars, but you found nothing. There is no true order to the natural universe except for that of raw and unbridled power. Chaos is the natural state of all things, and that‚Äôs how you like it. [social trait:: Unpredictable]                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 91‚Äì100    | *Bloodthirsty*‚ÄîThe first time you spilled a deserving foe‚Äôs blood and watched the thing‚Äôs life ebb out onto the hard ground, you found yourself filled with a mad, euphoric ecstasy like none other. The memory of this visceral experience returns to you in every battle, like an insatiable addiction that can only be abated with further bloodshed. [combat trait:: Bloodthirsty] [story feat:: Innocent Blood]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
