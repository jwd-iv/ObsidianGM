| 51â€“60     | *Ongoing Patron*â€”When you were young, a person with money or power took an interest in your art and sponsored you.

| 61â€“70     | *Spy*â€”Someone once asked you to employ your artistic talents as an excuse to observe a person, steal an object, or retrieve a piece of information, but were caught and `dice: [[PFBG#^Punishment]]`.

Your unique, unabashed vision resonated with the audience, revealing new perspectives as well as simple truths. Youâ€™re used to people quoting your words and looking up to you, though some authority figures deem you a rabble-rouser and troublemaker.
