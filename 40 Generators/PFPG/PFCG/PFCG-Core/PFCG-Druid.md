# PFCG-Druid

Druids come by their primal power in various ways. One [druid](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid) might receive her power from an [elemental](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Elemental) creature, and another might learn it from a beast or the [fey](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey). Roll on **Table: Druid Backgrounds** to determine the event that caused you to come into your power.

| 01â€“10     | *Lost in the Wild*â€”You got lost in the wilderness and were forced to survive on your own. You may have wandered desert dunes, thick forest, or high mountainsâ€”or perhaps you were shipwrecked on a desert island. Young and vulnerable, you feared the natural dangers of the world at first, but acclimated to the natural way of life as you learned to tap into the primal power of the world. [combat trait:: Resilient]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 11â€“20     | *Fey Meeting*â€”Walking in the woods, you met a [fey](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey) creature, such as a [brownie](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/fey/brownie), [elf](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/elf), [nymph](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/fey/nymph), [gnome](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/gnome), sprite, or [treant](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/plants/treant). This magical being taught you how to tend the natural world in the gentle manner of the [fey](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey). [magic trait:: Magical Knack] |
| 21â€“30     | *Spirit of Nature*â€”Through a ritual, vision, or dream. In the form of a majestic beast, this spirit charged you with preserving the natural world from those who would destroy it. You are instilled with the spirit of this creatureâ€”a small fragment of its power grows in you as you mature. [faith trait:: Sacred Touch]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 31â€“40     | *Tree Tender*â€”You learned to care for plants in your youth by tending a small garden, orchard, grove, or field. These plants flourished like no others. Youâ€™ve always understood plants better than people. [faith trait:: Devotee of the Green]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 41â€“50     | *Druid Circle*â€”You discovered, or were initiated into, a circle of [druids](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid) that protects an expanse of wilderness. The [druids](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid) taught you of their duty to nature and the powers that the natural world granted them. Soon you learned enough to join the circle as an initiate. [social trait:: Mentored]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 51â€“60     | *Civilized Outcast*â€”For a time, you lived in an urban environment. But you soon discovered that social communities, bureaucracies, and laws made you feel constrained and unnatural. You left civilization and retreated into the wild at the first opportunity. You still retain the lessons, habits, and refinements of civilized behavior, but your heart belongs to nature. [social trait:: Civilized]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 61â€“70     | *Savage*â€”You spent your formative years among a tribe or village far from civilization. The elders chose you as successor and taught you the lore of the elements and the [animals](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal). [social trait:: Savage]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 71â€“80     | *Raised by Beasts*â€”You were reared in part by wild [animals](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal). Most of what you know you learned by observing these beasts, their natural instincts being unburdened by artifice or manipulation. Even though you possess a [humanoid](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid) body, the beasts recognize you as one of their own. [gnome race trait:: Animal Friend] (which you may take regardless of your race) [story feat:: Feral Heart]                                                                                                                                                 |
| 81â€“90     | *Avatar*â€”Once you were an ordinary youth. But when the natural world needed saving, the land chose you as its champion, lending you as much power as you were able to control. You might not understand the reasons for your power, but you are one with nature and your will is the will of the world. [religion trait:: Child of Nature]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 91â€“100    | *Beastlord*â€”Natural birds and beasts have always obeyed you. From your earliest years, youâ€™ve possessed a gentleness or a power that allows you to communicate with [animals](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal) as though you shared a common language. Perhaps you have [fey](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey) blood or traces of [lycanthrope](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/lycanthrope) ancestry. [social trait:: Beast Bond]                                                                                                                                                                     |
