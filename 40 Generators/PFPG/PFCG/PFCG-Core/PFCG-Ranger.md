[Ranger](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger) are the hunters of legend. Although known for their ability to master varying environments and their dangers, [rangers](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger) often achieve this expertise through the dedicated pursuit of their quarry. Though such a target could be a lost or kidnapped friend or a forgotten ruin, more often a [rangerâ€™s](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger) target is a hated enemy, and no feature of the class lends itself better to the establishment of character than his [favored enemy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger#TOC-Favored-Enemy-Ex-). While a professional headhunter might hone his skills to track down [humans](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human) or other civilized folk, a [ranger](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger) whose family was murdered by ravenous [orcs](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/orc) likely has a different set of priorities while on the hunt. Roll on **Table: Ranger Backgrounds** to determine the formative events that led you to become a [ranger](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger).

| 01â€“10     | *An Eye for an Eye*â€”The choice of your [favored enemy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger#TOC-Favored-Enemy-Ex-) was nothing more than simple vengeance. Perhaps you lost a loved one, family, or even a whole community to the vicious rampaging of a ferocious beast, or saw your entire homeland swallowed up by monstrous hordes. No matter the reason, your drive to hunt down and destroy creatures of their kind wonâ€™t be sated so long as even one lives. [faith trait:: Tireless Avenger] [story feat:: Foeslayer]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 11â€“20     | *Ancient Hatred*â€”The history of your people is a saga of struggle against another race. Though common among [elves](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/elf) and [orcs](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/orc) or [dwarves](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/dwarf) and [giants](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/giants), many different races can have such longstanding animosity. Your choice of a [favored enemy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger#TOC-Favored-Enemy-Ex-) was a simple outgrowth of this racial antipathy. [social trait:: Knowing the Enemy]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 21â€“30     | *Big Game Hunter*â€”Whether you sought out the thrill of hunting large prey or merely grew up in the shadows of creatures large enough to crush an entire village with a careless step, you have learned how to be quick and to size up weaknesses in those behemoths who seem to have none. [combat trait:: Evasive Sting]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 31â€“40     | *Blood Cleansing*â€”Either you have forsaken your kinsfolk or they have forsaken you. Maybe you grew up among a wicked or corrupt people who you needed to escape, or maybe they exiled you for being different. Whatever the case, your own kind are now your [favored enemy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger#TOC-Favored-Enemy-Ex-), much to your continued chagrin or morbid amusement. [combat trait:: Scarred Descendant]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 41â€“50     | *Bounty Hunter*â€”You have always been good at finding and extracting people from their hidey-holes. Most likely you hunt [humanoids](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid) of either your own subtype or of one common to your region. [combat trait:: Easy Way or the Hard Way] [story feat:: Town Tamer]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 51â€“60     | *Detached Observer*â€”You set yourself apart with a pall of cold logic that allows you to see weaknesses in members of your own race that you strive not to succumb to yourself. Most likely, you pick your own race as your dominant [favored enemy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger#TOC-Favored-Enemy-Ex-), and you excel as a spy or assassin paid to capture enemies of your organization. [combat trait:: Cold and Calculating]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 61â€“70     | *Divine Purpose*â€”Not all those who hear the voices of the gods can distill that echo into magical power like [clerics](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric) or [oracles](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/oracle). These whispers of belief encouraged you to track and hunt those creatures who pose the greatest threat to your faith. Perhaps youâ€™re a good [ranger](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger) who hunts the [undead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead) or devotes effort to slaying fiends, or you could choose to target good [fey](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Fey) and celestials, emboldened by divine invective. [combat trait:: Faithâ€™s Hunter]                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 71â€“80     | *Nightmare Slayer*â€”From an early age, you stood up against some of the most terrifying creatures imaginable, facing off against creatures most mortals only dream of in their wildest [nightmares](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/witch#hex-nightmares). Possibly hailing from lands besieged by [dragons](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Dragon) or plagued by the living dead, you are not only resistant to the [fear](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Fear) such creatures normally engender, but you live to show your enemies the face of the unafraid. [faith trait:: Fearless Defiance]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 81â€“90     | *Opportunist*â€”You are an expert in creatures both common and exotic, particularly in terms of what valuable items you can harvest from their remains. The natural world exists for the benefit of those who know what to take, and you have learned how to scavenge pelts, toxins, and even rare spell [components](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components) from your defeated foes. You might pick [animals](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal), [magical beasts](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Magical-Beast), or [dragons](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Dragon) as your dominant [favored enemy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger#TOC-Favored-Enemy-Ex-)â€”or [humanoids](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid) if youâ€™re a particularly grisly trophy collector. [social trait:: Harvester] |
| 91â€“100    | *Survivalist*â€”You were orphaned at a young age and left to fend for yourself in the wilds, or simply lived a life at the edge of society that required a constant scrabble for basic existence. You probably have [animals](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal) or [magical beasts](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Magical-Beast) (the edible ones) as your dominant [favored enemy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger#TOC-Favored-Enemy-Ex-), and are adept at lying in wait and springing into action. [combat trait:: Hunterâ€™s Knack]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
