# I know a guy...

**Benefit:** Once per week, in any situation in which the party is in need of assistance (and it makes sense), the PC can declare ‚ÄúI know a guy‚Äù and then quickly sketch out that NPC and their relationship with that NPC with the DM. Upon declaration, that NPC exists. When the players try to interact with the NPC, the DM makes a secret Charisma check using the PC's CHA Modifier (and can add other modifiers, advantageous or disadvantageous, as appropriate) to see how the NPC reacts, determining where on the NPC Attitude scale the NPC will be at the time of the visit. Depending on the situation, the DM may decide whether the NPC is helpful or if the NPC hinders or outright betrays the party. This allows players to help create critical NPCs, while continuing to develop and reveal their character‚Äôs backstory

**Example:** The situation with Lando in The Empire Strikes Back is pretty much the perfect example

**Special 2:** The NPC must be a humanoid or monstrous humanoid of the PC's level or lower

**Special 3:** The Player does not go through character creation of the NPC. The Player simply gives a brief description of the NPC and the DM creates them (probably between sessions).

**Special 4:** The NPC will not directly assist the party. Rather, they act as a contact who can provide advice, information, lodging, or mundane equipment, assuming that they decide to help the party

**Special 5:** For simplicity, the DC for determining the NPC's attitude is as follows: If the roll equals 5 or less, they are Hostile. 6-10 is Unfriendly. 11-15 is Indifferent. 16-20 is Friendly. 21 and over is Helpful. Once they meet, the PC can roll Diplomacy to improve the attitude if at all possible. Of coarse, their attitude is likely unimportant if the task they are requested to help with is impossible or they are very difficult to find
