Brief:: Infects subject with chosen disease.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

The subject contracts one of the following diseases: blinding sickness, bubonic plague, cackle fever, filth fever, leprosy, mindfire, red ache, shakes, or slimy doom. The disease is contracted immediately (the onset period does not apply). Use the disease's listed frequency and save DC to determine further effects. For more information on these diseases, see page 557.


## (mythic)

The affected target is highly contagious. Any creature it touches or that touches it with natural weapons or unarmed strikes must save or contract the disease. The save DC for these targets is equal to the spell's DC - 4. The target can't spread this disease to you.


### augmented (7th)

If you expend five uses of mythic power, the spell targets every living creature within a 1-mile radius. You can select one creature per caster level within your line of sight; these creatures are unaffected by the spell.
