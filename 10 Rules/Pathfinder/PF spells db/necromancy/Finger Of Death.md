Brief:: Deals 10 damage/level to one subject.

This spell instantly delivers 10 points of damage per caster level. If the target's Fortitude saving throw succeeds, it instead takes 3d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level. The subject might die from damage even if it succeeds on its saving throw.


## (mythic)

The damage dealt increases to 15 points of damage per caster level plus 1d8 points of Constitution damage. A creature that succeeds at its saving throw takes 3d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level, takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage, and is staggered for 1 round.
