Brief:: As psychic crush I, but deal 9d6 + 1 points of damage per level on a save and no Fort save at 1/2 hp or fewer.

```dataviewjs

```

This functions as psychic crush I, but the target takes 9d6 points of damage + 1 point of damage per caster level on a successful Fortitude or Will save. The target does not receive any saving throw bonus because of its hit points. If it is at fewer than half its total hit points, it doesn't gain a Fortitude save to resist this spell but instead proceeds as if it had automatically failed its Fortitude save. This spell can be undercast.
