This spell functions as death knell aura, except a dying creature in the area cannot stabilize on its own and automatically takes 1 point of bleed damage on its turn each round. An incorporeal undead or living spirit traveling outside the body (such as a person using astral projection or magic jar) within the aura at the start of its turn takes 1d8 points of damage.
