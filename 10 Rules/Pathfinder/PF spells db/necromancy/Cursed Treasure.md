You touch a piece of treasure or container filled with treasure and place a terrible curse upon it, choosing from any option available with bestow curse. The next creature to take the treasure or remove items from the container is affected by the curse, unless it succeeds at a Will save (spell resistance applies). If you are the next creature to take the treasure or get objects from the container, though, the spell discharges harmlessly instead.
