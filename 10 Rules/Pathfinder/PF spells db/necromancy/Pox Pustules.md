Brief:: Subject is sickened and has â€“4 Dex.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

You inflict a painful, itching rash on the target creature. The target is sickened and takes a -4 penalty to Dexterity (this penalty cannot lower Dexterity below 0). The target can spend a move action scratching furiously at the rash to remove the sickened condition (but not the Dexterity penalty) until the start of its next turn.


## (mythic)

The Dexterity penalty increases to -6. The target takes 1 point of bleed damage each round. If the target spends a move action scratching, increase its bleed damage each round by 1. If the bleeding is stopped, scratching causes it to start again at 1 point of bleed per round.
