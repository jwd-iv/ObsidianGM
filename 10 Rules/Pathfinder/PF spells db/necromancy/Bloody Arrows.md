Brief:: 

Whenever this spell's target hits a creature with a ranged weapon that successfully deals piercing or slashing damage, the struck creature takes 1 point of bleed damage. Unlike most bleed damage, the bleed damage dealt by the subject of this spell is cumulative up to an amount equal to 1/2 your caster level (to a maximum of 5 points of bleed damage at 10th level).
