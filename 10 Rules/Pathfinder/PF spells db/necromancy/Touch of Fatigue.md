Brief:: Touch attack fatigues target.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

You channel negative energy through your touch, fatiguing the target. You must succeed on a touch attack to strike a target. The subject is immediately fatigued for the spell's duration.  This spell has no effect on a creature that is already fatigued.  Unlike with normal fatigue, the effect ends as soon as the spell's duration expires.
