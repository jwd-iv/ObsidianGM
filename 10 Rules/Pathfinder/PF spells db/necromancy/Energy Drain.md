Brief:: Subject gains 2d4 negative levels.

This spell functions like enervation, except that the creature struck gains 2d4 temporary negative levels. Twenty-four hours after gaining them, the subject must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC = energy drain spell's save DC) for each negative level. If the save succeeds, that negative level is removed. If it fails, that negative level becomes permanent. An undead creature struck by the ray gains 2d4x5 temporary hit points for 1 hour.
