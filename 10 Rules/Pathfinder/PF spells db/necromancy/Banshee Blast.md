Brief:: Cone deals 1d4 per level and panics creatures.

```

You create a cone of spectral energy resembling screaming elven ghosts that deals 1d4 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d4); a successful Reflex save halves this damage. Any creature that fails its Reflex save must succeed at a Will save or become panicked for 1 round/level.
