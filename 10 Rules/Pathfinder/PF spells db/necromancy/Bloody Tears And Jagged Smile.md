Your eyes turn black and weep blood, and your teeth become jagged fangs. You gain a bite attack (1d3 points of damage if you are Small, 1d4 points of damage if you are Medium). You gain a +4 profane bonus on Intimidate checks and on your spell DCs for spells with the fear descriptor. You perceive creatures as if using deathwatch.
