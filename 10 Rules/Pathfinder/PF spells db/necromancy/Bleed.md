Brief:: Cause a stabilized creature to resume dying.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

You cause a living creature that is below 0 hit points but stabilized to resume dying. Upon casting this spell, you target a living creature that has -1 or fewer hit points. That creature begins dying, taking 1 point of damage per round. The creature can be stabilized later normally. This spell causes a creature that is dying to take 1 point of damage.
