Brief:: 

You inflict a curse of the roiling sea upon the target, making it permanently sickened. Anytime the target is on or in the water more than a mile from shore, it also becomes staggered with seasickness. This curse cannot be dispelled, though remove curse or break enchantment can negate it.
