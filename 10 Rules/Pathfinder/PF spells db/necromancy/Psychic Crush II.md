Brief:: As psychic crush I, but deal 5d6 + 1 points of damage per level on a save and harder to resist.

```dataviewjs

```

This functions as psychic crush I, but on a successful Fortitude save, the target takes 5d6 points of damage + 1 point of  damage per caster level. In addition, the target receives a +4 circumstance bonus on the Fortitude save only if it is at full hit points; otherwise, it gains a +2 bonus if it has more than half its total hit points remaining. This spell can be undercast.
