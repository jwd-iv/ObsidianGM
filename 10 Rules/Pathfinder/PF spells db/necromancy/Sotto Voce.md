Brief:: 

Your dry, rasping whisper fills a living creature of 4 or fewer Hit Dice with unnatural dread. The affected creature must make a Will save or be shaken for 1 round.  This spell originated among the followers of the Whispering Way, but necromancers and other intimidating folk outside that group are known to use it.
