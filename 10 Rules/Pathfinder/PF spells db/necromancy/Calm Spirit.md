Brief:: Postpone hostile action by a haunt or incorporeal undead.

This spell temporarily calms agitated haunts and incorporeal undead such as ghosts. You have no control over the affected creatures, but calm spirit postpones hostile action by the affected spirits for the duration of the spell. Entities so affected cannot take violent actions or do anything destructive, including triggering persistent haunt abilities, though they can defend themselves. Any aggressive action against or damage dealt to a calmed spirit or haunt immediately ends the effect.  Haunts do not receive a saving throw against the spell, but the caster must succeed at a caster level check whose difficulty is equal to at least 10 + the haunt's CR in order to temporarily calm the angry entity. The spell's duration changes to concentration (up to 1 round/level) when affecting a haunt.
