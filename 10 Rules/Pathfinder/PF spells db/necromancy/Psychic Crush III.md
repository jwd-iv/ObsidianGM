Brief:: As psychic crush I, but deal 7d6 + 1 points of damage per level on a save and harder to resist.

This functions as psychic crush I, but the target takes 7d6 points of damage + 1 point of damage per caster level on a successful Fortitude save and 1 point of damage per caster level on a successful Will save. The target receives a +2 circumstance bonus on the Fortitude save if it is at full hit points, and no bonus if it has taken any damage. This spell can be undercast.
