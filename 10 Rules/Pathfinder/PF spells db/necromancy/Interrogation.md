Brief:: Target answers questions or suffers pain.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

You question the target, backed up by the threat of magical pain. You may ask one question per two caster levels. The target can either answer the question or take 1d4 points of damage plus your Wisdom bonus. The target is not compelled to answer truthfully, but the threat of pain gives it a -4 penalty on Bluff checks to convince you when it is lying.
