You greatly speed up the decomposition process of a nearby corpse and warp the fibers of time that permeate it, aging the corpse an additional amount of time equal to up to 1 day per 2 caster levels (maximum 10 days at 20th level). This spell prompts all the natural effects of the intended decomposition period, including crumbled clothing, rotted or liquefied flesh, maggot infestations, and the infiltration of any surrounding vegetation.  In addition to hindering mundane autopsies and investigations, this spell may effectively prohibit the use of raise dead on the target, though more powerful magic such as resurrection or true resurrection may still work.
