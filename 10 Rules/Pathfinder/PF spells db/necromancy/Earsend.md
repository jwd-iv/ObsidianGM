You cause one of your ears to tear itself free of your body and transform into a fly-like magical creature you control. This functions like skinsendUM, except your ear is a Fine construct with a fly speed equal to your base speed and a bonus on Fly checks equal to half your caster level. Your sense of hearing functions from your animated ear as if it were connected to your head, allowing you to hear as well as you normally could from your animated ear's vantage point.
