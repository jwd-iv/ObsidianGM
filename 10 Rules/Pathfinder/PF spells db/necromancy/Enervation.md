Brief:: Subject gains 1d4 negative levels.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

You point your finger and fire a black ray of negative energy that suppresses the life force of any living creature it strikes. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit. If you hit, the subject gains 1d4 temporary negative levels (see Appendix 1). Negative levels stack.  Assuming the subject survives, it regains lost levels after a number of hours equal to your caster level (maximum 15 hours).  Usually, negative levels have a chance of becoming permanent, but the negative levels from enervation don't last long enough to do so.  An undead creature struck by the ray gains 1d4 x 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour.


## (mythic)

The number of negative levels inflicted increases to 1d6, and the target is sickened for 24 hours. An undead creature struck by the ray gains 1d6 x 5 temporary hit points for a number of hours equal to your caster level.


### augmented (3rd)

If you expend two uses of mythic power, any creature attempting to remove the target's negative levels must succeed at a caster level check (DC 10 + your caster level + your tier).
