Brief:: Skeletal corpse grows flesh.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

You grow flesh on a decomposed or skeletonized corpse of a Medium or smaller creature, providing it with sufficient flesh that it can be animated as a zombie rather than a skeleton. The corpse looks as it did when the creature died. The new flesh is somewhat rotted and not fit for eating.
