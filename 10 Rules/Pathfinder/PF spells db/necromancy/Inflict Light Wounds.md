Brief:: Touch deals 1d8 damage +1/level (max +5).

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

When laying your hand upon a creature, you channel negative energy that deals 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +5).  Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell cures such a creature of a like amount of damage, rather than harming it.


## (mythic)

The damage dealt increases to 2d8 points of damage + 2 points per caster level (maximum +10). A living target is sickened for 1 round per caster level (maximum 5 rounds) if it fails its saving throw.
