Brief:: Heals one undead of 1d8 hp + 1/level (max +5).

When you touch an undead creature, you channel negative energy that heals 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +5). This spell has no effect on living creatures, except those that are healed by negative energy are also healed by the spell.
