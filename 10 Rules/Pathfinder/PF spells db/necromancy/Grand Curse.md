You can use the grand curse to duplicate the effects of major curse, except the DC to remove the curse is equal to the save DC +10, or the grand curse can be used to place a permanent curse on an area.  If used to place a curse on an area, the caster may affect one 10 ft. by 10 ft. square per caster level.  The nature of the grand curse is decided by the spellcaster upon conclusion of the ritual, which takes 1 hour to complete; any of the effects of bestow curse may be placed upon the area, and any time a target comes into contact with the area they are subject to the curse. If another spell effect is desired, the grand curse may duplicate any compulsion spell of 4th level or less. The player should be creative with the types of curses available, but should be in line with the above restrictions.
