Brief:: Ray causes 1d6 Str penalty + 1 per 2 levels.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

A coruscating ray springs from your hand. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to strike a target. The subject takes a penalty to Strength equal to 1d6+1 per two caster levels (maximum 1d6+5).  The subject's Strength score cannot drop below 1. A successful Fortitude save reduces this penalty by half. This penalty does not stack with itself. Apply the highest penalty instead.


## (mythic)

The Strength penalty increases to 1d8 + 1 per 2 caster levels (maximum +10). If the target fails its save, it's fatigued.
