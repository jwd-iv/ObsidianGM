Brief:: Arrow or bolt poisons target.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

You infuse a single arrow or crossbow bolt with natural venom as you fire it. In addition to its normal damage, anyone struck by this arrow or bolt is affected as if by the poison spell. If the arrow is not fired immediately, the spell ends with no effect.
