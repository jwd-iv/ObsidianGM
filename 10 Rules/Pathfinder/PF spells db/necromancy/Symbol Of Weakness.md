Brief:: Triggered rune weakens nearby creatures.

```dataviewjs

```

This spell functions like symbol of death, except that every creature within 60 feet of a symbol of weakness instead suffers crippling weakness that deals 3d6 points of Strength damage.  Unlike symbol of death, symbol of weakness has no hit point limit; once triggered, a symbol of weakness simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level. A creature can only be affected by this symbol once.  Note: Magic traps such as symbol of weakness are hard to detect and disable. While any character can use Perception to find a symbol, only a character with the trapfinding class feature can use Disable Device to disarm it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 32 for symbol of weakness.
