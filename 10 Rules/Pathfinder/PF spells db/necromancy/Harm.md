Brief:: Deals 10 points/level damage to target.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

Harm charges a subject with negative energy that deals 10 points of damage per caster level (to a maximum of 150 points at 15th level). If the creature successfully saves, harm deals half this amount. Harm cannot reduce the target's hit points to less than 1.  If used on an undead creature, harm acts like heal.


## (mythic)

The damage dealt increases to 15 points of damage per caster level (maximum 225 points).


### augmented

If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell also acts as poison.
