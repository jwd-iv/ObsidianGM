You draw upon your body's inner reserves of strength, leaving you winded. When you are about to make a d20 roll based on Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution, you can cast this spell to gain a +8 enhancement bonus to Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution for that roll, but you are fatigued for 1 round afterward.
