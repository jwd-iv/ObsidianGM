Brief:: As animal aspect, but you gain two animal qualities.

This spell functions like animal aspect, except you can either gain two aspects at once or one aspect that adds effects to the aspects that animal aspect grants, as described below.  Frog: You gain a Swim speed equal to half your normal speed, and all the benefits of having a swim speed.  Gorilla: You gain a +2 competence bonus on Perception checks, and a +1 competence bonus on Fortitude saves.  Monkey: You gain a +4 competence bonus on Acrobatics checks.  Otter: Your swim speed increases to your full normal speed, and you need not make concentration checks to cast spells underwater.  Raccoon: Your competence bonuses on Disable Device, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth checks increase to +4.  Raptor: Your enhancement bonus to speed increases to +30 feet, and you gain the benefit of the Run feat.  Tree Lizard: You gain a +4 competence bonus on Stealth checks.
