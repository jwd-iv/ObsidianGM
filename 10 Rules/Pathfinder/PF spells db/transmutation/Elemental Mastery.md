You gain mastery over the element matching the elemental essence in your blood (fire for ifrits, earth for oreads, air for sylphs, and water for undines). If you are a suli, you can choose any one of the four options as you cast this spell, but the duration is reduced to 1 round per level. Your mastery gives you an insight bonus to your speed or a new movement mode, depending on the element you master, and grants one additional benefit. This spell's descriptor matches the chosen element.  Element (Race) Movement Benefit  Air Fly 30 ft. +1 circumstance bonus (suli, sylph) (average) on attack rolls when both you and your foe are airborne.  Earth Burrow 15 ft. +1 circumstance bonus (oread, suli) on attack rolls when both you and your foe are touching the ground.  Fire +20 ft. +1 circumstance bonus (ifrit, suli) all speeds on attack rolls when your foe is on fire.  Water +30 ft. +1 circumstance bonus (suli, undine) swim on attack rolls when both you and your foe are touching water.
