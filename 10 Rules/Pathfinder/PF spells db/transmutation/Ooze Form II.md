This spell functions as ooze form I except you can also assume the form of a Large ooze. You gain blindsight 30 feet and immunity to critical hits and precision damage as well. Large Ooze: If you assume this form, you gain a +2 size bonus to your Strength score, a +8 size bonus to your Constitution score, a slam attack (2d4 plus 1d6 acid and grab), and constrict (2d4), and you take a -8 penalty to your Dexterity score.
