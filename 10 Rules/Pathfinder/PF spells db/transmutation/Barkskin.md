Brief:: Grants +2 (or higher) enhancement to natural armor.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

Barkskin toughens a creature's skin. The effect grants a +2 enhancement bonus to the creature's existing natural armor bonus. This enhancement bonus increases by 1 for every three caster levels above 3rd, to a maximum of +5 at 12th level.  The enhancement bonus provided by barkskin stacks with the target's natural armor bonus, but not with other enhancement bonuses to natural armor. A creature without natural armor has an effective natural armor bonus of +0.


## (mythic)

The target also gains DR/magic equal to the double the enhancement bonus the spell provides to the target's natural armor bonus.


### augmented (6th)

If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell grants DR/epic rather than DR/magic.
