You grant a touched Large or smaller object the ability to fly at a speed of 40 feet with average maneuverability. It can ascend at half speed and descend at double speed. The targeted object flies as you direct it, using your Fly skill for any difficult maneuvers. You must be within close range (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels) of the object to direct it, and moving it requires a move action. If not directed, the object hovers in place (no Fly check required). The maximum weight of the object and anything carried by it is 500 pounds per caster level (maximum 10,000 pounds).


## (mythic)

If you expend one use of mythic power, you double themaximum weight of the object you can imbue with flight. You canexpend additional uses of mythic power to increase the maximumsize of the object you can imbue with flight. Imbuing a Huge objectrequires two uses of mythic power, imbuing a Gargantuan objectrequires four uses, and imbuing a Colossal object requires eightuses. These costs include the expenditure to cast a mythic spell,and count toward doubling the weight limit of the spell.Two or more casters can cast this spell in concert to share themythic power cost. Each caster must expend an additional use ofmythic power to cooperate; this does not count toward the other costsor effects of the spell. The group chooses which caster has controlof the flight. As a full-round action, the controlling caster can cedecontrol to another caster involved in the original casting of the spell.
