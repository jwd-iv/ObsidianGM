This spell's energy quickens your steps, allowing fancy footwork. You gain a +10-foot enhancement bonus to your speed and a +1 dodge bonus to your AC. These bonuses do not stack with those granted by haste or similar effects. While under the effects of Aldori alacrity, you can take 5-foot steps in difficult terrain.
