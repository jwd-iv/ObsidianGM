Brief:: One natural weapon of subject creature gets +1 on attack and damage rolls.

Magic fang gives one natural weapon or unarmed strike of the subject a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. The spell can affect a slam attack, fist, bite, or other natural weapon.  The spell does not change an unarmed strike's damage from nonlethal damage to lethal damage.  Magic fang can be made permanent with a permanency spell.


## (mythic)

The spell affects an additional number of the target's natural weapons equal to your tier. For example, if you're 3rd tier, it could affect two claws and one bite).
