Brief:: Melee weapon destroys undead.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

This spell makes a melee weapon deadly to undead. Any undead creature with HD equal to or less than your caster level must succeed on a Will save or be destroyed utterly if struck in combat with this weapon. Spell resistance does not apply against the destruction effect.
