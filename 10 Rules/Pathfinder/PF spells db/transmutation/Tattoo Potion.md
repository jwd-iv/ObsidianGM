Brief:: 

When you cast this spell, you mix special tattoo inks into a potion of your choice. Once you finish casting tattoo potion, the potion begins bubbling and fizzing-if no one drinks the potion within 1 minute of the spell being cast, the potion bubbles away into vapor and is destroyed.  When a potion under the effects of tattoo potion is imbibed, the effects of the potion do not occur. Instead, the potion transforms into a spell tattoo (see page 16) on the drinker's chest tattoo slot-if the drinker already has a magic tattoo in this location, the tattoo potion is wasted. Once the potion transforms into a spell tattoo, it remains in place permanently until it is used as a spell tattoo.
