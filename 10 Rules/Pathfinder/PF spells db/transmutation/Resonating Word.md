Brief:: Target is damaged, staggered, and stunned.

```dataviewjs

```

You speak a terrible word of power, setting up potentially lethal vibrations in the chosen target. The target must save once each round on your turn, and the effects grow stronger for each saving throw the creature fails.  On the first round, the target takes 5d6 points of sonic damage and is staggered for 1 round. A successful save halves the damage and negates the staggered effect.  On the second round, the target takes 5d6 points of damage and is stunned for 1 round. A successful save halves the damage and negates the stunning effect.  On the third round, the target takes 10d6 points of damage and is stunned for 1d4+1 rounds. A successful save halves the damage and negates the stunning effect.  The resonating word has no power after the third round, even if the spell's duration is increased.


## (mythic)

The damage dealt increases to 8d6 points on the 1st and 2nd rounds and 15d6 on the 3rd round. The target takes a -4 penalty on saving throws against all sonic effects.
