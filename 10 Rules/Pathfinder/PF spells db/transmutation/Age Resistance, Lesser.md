Brief:: Ignore penalties from middle age.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

You ignore the physical detriments of being middle-aged. This spell does not cause you to look younger, nor does it prevent you from dying of old age, but as long as the spell is in effect, you ignore the -1 penalties to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution that accrue once you become middle-aged. You retain the agerelated bonuses to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma while under the effects of this spell. Additional penalties that you accrue upon becoming old or venerable apply in full.
