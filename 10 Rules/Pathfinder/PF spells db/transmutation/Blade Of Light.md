This spell infuses a weapon with pure sunlight (the weapon need not be a bladed weapon). A weapon enhanced by this spell sheds light as if daylight had been cast on it. It functions as a magic and good weapon for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. The weapon grants a +2 sacred bonus on attack rolls against undead and deals +1d6 points of damage on a successful hit against such foes; against incorporeal undead, it functions as if it had the ghost touch weapon special ability. The weapon automatically confirms critical hits against foes that are vulnerable to sunlight.
