Brief:: Targeted creature's attacks target a random square instead of the intended target.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

You distort the space around a creature, twisting the path of its melee attacks unpredictably, but always toward a nearby creature that the target threatens. Until the start of your next turn, melee attacks made by the target creature affect a random target instead of their intended target.
