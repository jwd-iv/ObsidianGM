Sometimes Irori smiles on his worshipers, granting them a reprieve from physical hunger. This spell magically enhances a handful of simple food, imbuing it with enough nutrition to satisfy a Medium or smaller creature for a full day. The spell does not create food, and thus will not alone prevent someone from starving, but it can extend even limited reserves for lengthy periods.
