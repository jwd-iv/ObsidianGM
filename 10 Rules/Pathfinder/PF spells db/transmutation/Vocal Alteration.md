Brief:: Disguise target's voice.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

You alter the target's voice to something else. For example, you could make the target's voice high-pitched, husky, or nasal, or change its accent to an accent you are familiar with.  If this spell is used as part of a disguise, the target gets a +10 bonus on the Disguise check when trying to fool a listener.  The target can vary the disguised voice just as it could its normal voice. For example, a halfling female given a male dwarf noble's voice and accent could speak in falsetto, with a rural halfling accent, and so on.
