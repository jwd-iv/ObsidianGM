Brief:: Triggered rune slows creatures.

This spell functions as symbol of death, except all creatures within 60 feet of a symbol of slowing are slowed (as the slow spell) for 1 round per caster level.  Symbol of slowing can be made permanent with a permanency spell by a caster of 11th level or higher for the cost of 10,000 gp.
