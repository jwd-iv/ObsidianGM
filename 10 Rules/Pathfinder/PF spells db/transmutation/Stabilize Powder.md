Brief:: Ammunition in the targeted firearm is less likely to misfire.

```dataviewjs

```

Ammunition currently loaded in the target firearm is less prone to misfire. Decrease the misfire range by 1 + 1 per five caster levels (maximum +5, minimum misfire 0) for the ammunition currently loaded into that firearm.
