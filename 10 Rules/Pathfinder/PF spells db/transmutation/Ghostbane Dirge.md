Brief:: Incorporeal creature takes half damage from nonmagical weapons.

```dataviewjs

```

The target coalesces into a semi-physical form for a short period of time. While subject to the spell, the incorporeal creature takes half damage (50%) from nonmagical attack forms, and full damage from magic weapons, spells, spell-like effects, and supernatural effects.
