Brief:: Weapons are keen while you concentrate.

This functions like keen edge, except it affects multiple weapons and requires your concentration. You select the weapons to be affected, and can only affect one weapon per creature. If a creature's weapon exceeds the spell's range, the spell ends for that weapon.
