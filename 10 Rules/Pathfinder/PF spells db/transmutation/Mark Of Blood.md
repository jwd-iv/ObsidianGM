You place a drop of your blood on a weapon and charge it with magic so that you transfer a small amount of your life essence to the next living creature you strike with the weapon. Thereafter, you can spend a move action to know the direction and general distance of that creature. The target can negate this effect with a successful Will save. You must strike a creature within 1 minute of casting this spell or the magic is wasted, but once the mark of blood takes effect it is permanent until dispelled or removed via an effect like remove curse.
