```dataviewjs

```

This spell functions as monstrous physique III except it allows you to use more abilities. If the form you assume has any of the following abilities, you gain the listed ability: burrow 60 feet, climb 90 feet, fly 120 feet (good maneuverability), swim 120 feet, blindsense 60 feet, darkvision 90 feet, low-light vision, scent, tremorsense 60 feet, blood frenzy, breath weapon, cold vigor, constrict, ferocity, freeze, grab, horrific appearance, jet, leap attack, mimicry, natural cunning, overwhelming, poison, pounce, rake, rend, roar, sound mimicry, speak with sharks, spikes, trample, trip, and web. If the creature has immunity or resistance to any energy types, you gain resistance 20 to those energy types. If the creature has vulnerability to an energy type, you gain that vulnerability. If the creature has immunity to poison, you gain a +8 bonus on saves against poison.


## (mythic)

Each mythic monstrous physique spell must be learned individually, and you must know the respective non-mythic monstrous physique spell to learn its mythic version. You don't have to learn them in order, and aren't required to know a lower-level mythic monstrous physique spell before you learn a higher-level one (for example, you can learn mythic monstrous physique II if you know monstrous physique II, even if you don't know mythic monstrous physique I). Each mythic monstrous physique spell adds the following benefits to its respective non-mythic version. The spell's bonuses to ability scores increase by 2 each, the natural armor bonus increases by 1, and the ability score penalties decrease by 2 each (minimum penalty of 0). Alternatively, you can cast this spell on another willing creature, changing the range to touch and the target to one creature.


### augmented (4th)

If you expend two uses of mythic power, the ability score bonuses increase by an additional 2. Additionally, you can cast this spell on other willing creatures, changing the range to touch and the target to one creature per tier.
