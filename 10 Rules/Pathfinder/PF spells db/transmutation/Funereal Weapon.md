You imbue a weapon with a faint silvery glow that dimly illuminates a 5-foot square. An affected weapon also easily bypasses the physical defenses of undead creatures, ignoring 5 points of an undead creature's damage reduction, as long as the damage reduction is not DR/epic. For example, attacks with a weapon affected by this spell completely ignore a zombie's DR 5/slashing or reduce a lich's damage reduction to DR 10/bludgeoning and magic.  You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as an unarmed strike. Funereal weapon affects the DR of only undead creatures.
