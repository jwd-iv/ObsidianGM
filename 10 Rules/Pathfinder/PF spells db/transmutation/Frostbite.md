Brief:: Target takes cold damage and is fatigued.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

Your melee touch attack deals 1d6 points of nonlethal cold damage + 1 point per level, and the target is fatigued. The fatigued condition ends when the target recovers from the nonlethal damage. This spell cannot make a creature exhausted even if it is already fatigued. You can use this melee touch attack up to one time per level.
