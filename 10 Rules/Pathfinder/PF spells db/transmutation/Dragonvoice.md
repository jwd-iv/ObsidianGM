By magically altering the way your vocal cords create sounds, you can emulate the vocal inflections of dragons. This grants a +6 circumstance bonus on Charisma checks and Charisma-related skill checks when dealing with dragons.  In addition, your voice is much louder than normal, halving the penalties to others' Perception checks to hear you due to distance, intervening doors, and so on.
