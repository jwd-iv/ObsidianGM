Brief:: Grant a target the ability to see through plant matter as if it were transparent.

The target of this spell gains the ability to see up to 60 feet through thick plant matter as though it were transparent. Greenery, leaves, and vines-even lichen, moss, and slime-offer no concealment to the recipient's sight, though her vision still can be blocked by solid wood, such as trees or wooden structures. Undergrowth does not grant concealment to a creature against a target of the effects of greensight.
