Brief:: Your claws, unarmed strikes, and touch spells affect ethereal creatures.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

Your hands reach simultaneously into the Ethereal and Material planes, allowing you to deal normal damage with claws, unarmed strikes, and touch spells or effects to ethereal creatures. Miss chance due to etherealness (such as from the blink spell) doesn't apply, though miss chance based on concealment does.
