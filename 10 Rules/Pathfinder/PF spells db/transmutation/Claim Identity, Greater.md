This spell functions as per claim identity, except it transforms its target into  a helpless, inanimate porcelain mask for the spell's duration. The target remains aware of everything it can see or hear while transformed. The target can't speak or move, but can still take purely mental actions (such as casting certain spells) or be targeted by spells that affect its mind.  Any creature donning this mask is transformed into a flawless imitation of the spell's target, as if affected by claim identity, and reverts to its natural form upon removing the mask. Any damage dealt to the mask immediately ends this spell.
