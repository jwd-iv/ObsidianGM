This spell functions like [[Gaseous Form]], except the target becomes a visible swirl of hot ash and smoke instead of harmless translucent gas. The target gains the fire subtype. Any creature that begins its turn sharing a space with the target takes 2d6 points of fire damage and must make a Fortitude save (DC 15, + 1 per previous check) or suffer the effects of smoke inhalation (Core Rulebook 444).


## (mythic)

The damage dealt increases to 3d6 points of fire damage. This otherwise makes the same changes as mythic gaseous form.


### augmented

If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target can shift into or out of scorching ash form as a move action.
