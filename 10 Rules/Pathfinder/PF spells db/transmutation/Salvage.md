An invisible force pulls together the remains of a shipwreck. Bits of hull, tattered sails, broken masts, and smashed figureheads knit themselves back together. Rotten wood turns solid once more, and sails re-weave themselves as the rigging snakes across the masts. It takes a variable amount of time for the ship to rebuild itself, depending on its size. Size Duration Raft 1 minute Rowboat 1 minute Keelboat 10 minutes Longship 1 hour Sailing ship 2 hours Warship 3 hours Galleon 4 hours At the end of the duration, an air bubble forms around the repaired ship. If submerged, the ship shoots to the surface, erupting with a great splash before settling on the water. Though the spell requires time to repair the ship, its effects are instantaneous. A salvaged ship cannot be dispelled to return it to a shipwreck. However, before the spell's duration ends and while the ship is still being repaired, salvage can be dispelled to interrupt the repair process. The ship remains in the condition it was in when the spell was interrupted until a new salvage spell is cast (but continues to age normally and suffers the effects of its environments). A new salvage spell's duration is modified by any repairs already begun.
