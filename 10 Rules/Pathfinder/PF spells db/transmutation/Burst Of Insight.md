Brief:: Gain a +8 bonus to Int, Wis, or Cha for one roll, then be dazed for 1 round.

You plumb the depths of your mind for insight, leaving you momentarily frazzled. When you are about to make a d20 roll based on Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, you can cast this spell to gain a +8 enhancement bonus to Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma for that roll, but you are dazed for 1 round afterward.
