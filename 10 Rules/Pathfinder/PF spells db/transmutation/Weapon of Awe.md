Brief:: Weapon gets +2 on damage rolls.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

You transform a single weapon into an awe-inspiring instrument. The weapon gains a +2 sacred bonus on damage rolls, and if the weapon scores a critical hit, the target of that critical hit becomes shaken for 1 round with no saving throw.  This is a mind-affecting fear effect. A ranged weapon affected by this spell applies these effects to its ammunition.  You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, but you can cast it on an unarmed strike.
