Brief:: Slough off a targetâ€™s skin.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

The target takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round as its skin loosens and splits. Once it has taken 5 or more points of Constitution damage in this way, its skin falls off to reveal its musculature. The creature ceases taking Constitution damage, but takes a -4 penalty on saving throws against disease, pain effects, or poison, and on Charisma-based skill checks with the exception of Intimidate and Use Magic Device. The creature's skin regrows rapidly-once its Constitution damage is fully healed, its skin becomes intact once again and the penalties end.
