Upon striking a piece of solid ground with the spell's focus or a holy symbol, you let out a wave of energy that repairs items within its burst. All objects or constructs within the burst are repaired of 1d6 points of damage per level. When this spell affects constructs, the spell bypasses any immunity to magic as if the spell did not allow spell resistance.  Hammer of mending can fix destroyed magic items (items with 0 hit points or fewer), and restores the magic properties of the item if your caster level is at least twice that of the item.  Items with charges (such as wands) and single-use items (such as potions and scrolls) cannot be repaired in this way.
