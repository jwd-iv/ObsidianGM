Trees, shrubs, and other thick vegetation move out of the spell's area. The affected area is cleared of all vegetation thick enough to provide cover or concealment. This also creates a hole in any tree canopy, allowing sunlight to pass through. Affected trees and undergrowth form a 5-foot-wide ring along the edge of the clearing, which may provide cover or concealment based on the thickness of the vegetation (at the GM's discretion).  This spell doesn't affect creatures of the plant type. The spell can affect vegetation altered with spells of equal or lower level (such as entangle or spike growth). When the spell ends, the trees and undergrowth move back to their original places unless they're destroyed or somehow restrained (the amount of time this takes is subject to the GM's discretion).
