Brief:: Shrinks one willing animal.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

This spell functions like reduce person, except that it affects a single willing animal. Reduce the damage dealt by the animal's natural attacks as appropriate for its new size (see Chapter 6 how to adjust damage for size).
