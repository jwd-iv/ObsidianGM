Brief:: Siege engine gains +1 on targeting and damage rolls for every four caster levels.

```dataviewjs

```

This spell functions like magic siege weapon, except it gives an indirect fire siege weapon an enhancement bonus on targeting and damage rolls of +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5). If used on a direct-fire siege weapon, this spell functions as greater magic weapon.
