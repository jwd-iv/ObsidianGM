This spell alters details of your appearance so that you are no longer recognizable as yourself. Your new appearance is within the norms for your race, ethnicity, and gender. You lack control over the details of your appearance; however, when casting false face, you can choose an appearance you previously used, allowing you to maintain specific identities.
