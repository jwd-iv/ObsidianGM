Brief:: Armor or shield gains +1 enhancement per four levels.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

You imbue a suit of armor or a shield with an enhancement bonus of +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5 at 20th level).  An outfit of regular clothing counts as armor that grants no AC bonus for the purpose of this spell.


## (mythic)

You can add one armor special ability to the target if it's armor or one shield special ability if it's a shield. The special ability must have a base price modifier no greater than a +1 enhancement bonus or 4,000 gp.


### augmented (3rd)

If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can add any number of special abilities with a total base price modifier no greater than a +2 enhancement bonus or 15,000 gp.
