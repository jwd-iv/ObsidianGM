Brief:: As alter self, but you can change the shape as a swift action.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

This spell functions as alter self, except you can as a swift action alter the disguise (within the limitations of alter self).  For example, you could transform yourself into a halfling, then a lizardfolk, then an elf, and so on. You can change your form a number of times equal to your caster level.
