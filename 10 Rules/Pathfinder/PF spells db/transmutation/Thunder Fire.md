Brief:: Ammunition in the targeted firearm deafens opponents.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

The firearm targeted creates a thunderous report, even if the firearm is not loaded. Every creature within 15 feet of the creature wielding or carrying the firearm must succeed at a Fortitude save or be deafened for 1 minute. The creature wielding or carrying the firearm takes a -4 penalty on this saving throw, and his misfire range increases by 1 for 1d4 rounds. If the firearm was loaded when it was targeted by this spell, that ammunition is wasted.
