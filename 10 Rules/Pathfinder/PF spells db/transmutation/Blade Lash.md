Brief:: Use your weapon like a whip to trip an opponent.

```dataviewjs

```

Your weapon elongates and becomes whiplike. As part of casting this spell, you can use this weapon to attempt a trip combat maneuver against one creature within 20 feet, and you gain a +10 bonus on your roll, after which the weapon returns to its previous form.
