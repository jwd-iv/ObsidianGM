Brief:: Temporarily change a target into an animal, humanoid, or monstrous humanoid.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

You change the target into an animal (as per beast shape I), humanoid (as per alter self), or monstrous humanoid (as per monstrous physique IUM). The chosen form can't have a fly speed. The subject's statistics change as per the appropriate spell except the creature's ability scores and natural armor do not change. The creature can change between its natural form and the chosen form at will as a standard action.
