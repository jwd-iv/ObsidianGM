Brief::

```

This spell repairs 1d6 points of damage plus 1 point per level when cast on a construct creature (maximum 10d6+10).  Greater make whole can fix destroyed magic items or technological items (items at 0 hit points or fewer), and restores the magic properties of the item if your caster level at least equal to that of the item. This spell otherwise functions as make whole.
