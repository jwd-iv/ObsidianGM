Brief:: Weapon gains +1 bonus/four levels (max +5).

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

This spell functions like magic weapon, except that it gives a weapon an enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls of +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5). This bonus does not allow a weapon to bypass damage reduction aside from magic.  Alternatively, you can affect as many as 50 arrows, bolts, or bullets.  The projectiles must be of the same kind, and they have to be together (in the same quiver or other container). Projectiles, but not thrown weapons, lose their transmutation after they are used.  Treat shuriken as projectiles, rather than as thrown weapons, for the purpose of this spell.


## (mythic)

You can add one of the following weapon special abilities to the weapon: flaming, frost, keen, merciful, shock, or thundering.


### augmented (5th)

If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can reduce the granted enhancement bonus by 1 to add two of the above abilities or one of the following abilities: anarchic, axiomatic, flaming burst, holy, icy burst, shocking burst, or unholy.
