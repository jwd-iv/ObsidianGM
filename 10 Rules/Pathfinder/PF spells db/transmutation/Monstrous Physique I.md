```dataviewjs

```

When you cast this spell, you can assume the form of any Small or Medium creature of the monstrous humanoid type. If the form you assume has any of the following abilities, you gain the listed ability: climb 30 feet, fly 30 feet (average maneuverability), swim 30 feet, darkvision 60 feet, low-light vision, and scent. If the form you assume has the aquatic subtype, you gain the aquatic and amphibious subtypes.  Small monstrous humanoid: If the form you take is that of a Small monstrous humanoid, you gain a +2 size bonus to your Dexterity and a +1 natural armor bonus.  Medium monstrous humanoid: If the form you take is that of a Medium monstrous humanoid, you gain a +2 size bonus to your Strength and a +2 natural armor bonus.


## (mythic)

Each mythic monstrous physique spell must be learned individually, and you must know the respective non-mythic monstrous physique spell to learn its mythic version. You don't have to learn them in order, and aren't required to know a lower-level mythic monstrous physique spell before you learn a higher-level one (for example, you can learn mythic monstrous physique II if you know monstrous physique II, even if you don't know mythic monstrous physique I). Each mythic monstrous physique spell adds the following benefits to its respective non-mythic version. The spell's bonuses to ability scores increase by 2 each, the natural armor bonus increases by 1, and the ability score penalties decrease by 2 each (minimum penalty of 0). Alternatively, you can cast this spell on another willing creature, changing the range to touch and the target to one creature.


### augmented (4th)

If you expend two uses of mythic power, the ability score bonuses increase by an additional 2. Additionally, you can cast this spell on other willing creatures, changing the range to touch and the target to one creature per tier.
