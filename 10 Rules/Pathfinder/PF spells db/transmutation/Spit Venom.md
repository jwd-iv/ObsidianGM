Brief:: Spit blinding black adder venom.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

You spit a stream of venom at a target using a ranged touch attack. If the venom hits, it causes blindness for 1 round. The target must also save or be poisoned by black adder venom; the DC in successive rounds of the poison is equal to the spell's DC.
