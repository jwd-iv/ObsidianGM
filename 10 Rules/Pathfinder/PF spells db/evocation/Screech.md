Brief:: Foes provoke attacks of opportunity.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

You emit a shrill, piercing shriek, startling those around you into dropping their guard. Enemies in the area must make a successful saving throw or immediately provoke attacks of opportunity from foes that threaten them. You and your allies are unaffected by your own screech.
