Brief:: Target is staggered by a painful sound.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

You emit an ear-splitting shriek which can be heard only by the target of this spell; all other observers merely see you screaming silently. The target suffers wracking pain from the scream, gaining the staggered condition. This spell has no effect on deaf creatures and cannot penetrate an area of silence.
