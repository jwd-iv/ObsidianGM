Pain strike racks the targeted creature with agony, inflicting 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per round for 1 round per level (maximum 10 rounds). Additionally, the affected creature is sickened for the spell's duration, and the caster gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks against the target.
