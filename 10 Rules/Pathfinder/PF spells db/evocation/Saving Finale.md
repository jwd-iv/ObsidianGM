Brief:: Subject rerolls failed saving throw.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

You must have a bardic performance in effect to cast this spell. With a flourish, you can immediately end your bardic performance when a creature within range affected by your bardic performance fails a saving throw, allowing the subject to immediately reroll the failed saving throw.


## (mythic)

Add your tier as a bonus on the saving throw reroll.
