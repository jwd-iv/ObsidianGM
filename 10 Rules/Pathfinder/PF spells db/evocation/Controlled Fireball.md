Brief:: As fireball, but secretly deals less damage to your allies.

This spell functions as fireball except you can cause the bead of fire to originate from anywhere you can see within range. You can choose a number of squares within the area up to your Intelligence bonus (for magi, occultists, or wizards) or Charisma bonus (for bloodragers or sorcerers) to be struck by weaker flames; the controlled fireball deals minimum damage in those squares.  Attempts to identify controlled fireball with a skill check incorrectly identify it as fireball (see the ruse descriptor o n page 192).
