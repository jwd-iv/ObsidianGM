Brief:: 

You create a warhammer of magically hardened ice and send it hurling toward the target. You must succeed at a ranged touch attack to strike the target. If hit, the target takes 1d8 points of damage per 2 caster levels you possess (maximum 5d8); half this damage is bludgeoning damage, half is cold damage. The frosthammer counts as having a +1 enhancement bonus for the purpose of bypassing DR. If the target takes any bludgeoning damage from the hammer, you may attempt a trip combat maneuver check against that target, except you may use your caster level instead of your BAB and your spellcasting ability modifier (Wisdom for clerics, and so on) instead of your Strength modifier.
