You create a disk of sunlight on one arm. Any creature that strikes you with a melee attack deals normal damage, but also takes 1d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level. Half of this damage is fire damage and half is holy damage (as the spell flame strike). An undead creature or a creature particularly vulnerable to light that hits you instead takes 2d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level. Creatures with reach weapons are not subject to this damage if they attack you. The shield provides illumination equivalent to a daylight spell. You can have only one instance of this spell in effect at a time. It does not stack with similar damaging aura spells such as fire shield or shield of the Dawnflower (The Inner Sea World Guide 296).
