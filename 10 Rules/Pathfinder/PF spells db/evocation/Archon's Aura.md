Brief:: Aura penalizes enemy attacks and AC.

```

You gain a powerful aura, similar to an archon's aura of menace.  Any hostile creature within a 20-foot radius of you must make a Will save to resist the effects of this aura. If the creature fails, it takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls and saving throws and to Armor Class for the duration of this spell, or until it successfully hits you with an attack. A creature that has resisted or broken the cannot be affected again by this particular casting of archon's aura.
