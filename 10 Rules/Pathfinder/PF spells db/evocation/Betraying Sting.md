Brief:: 

You unleash divine power to smite those who wrongly trusted you. The power takes the form of a yellow-and-black bolt of energy that makes the sound of a thousand angry, swarming wasps. This spell affects only creatures that have an attitude toward you of indifferent, friendly, or helpful. The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per 2 caster levels you have.
