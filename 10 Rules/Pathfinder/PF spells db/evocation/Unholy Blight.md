Brief:: Harms and sickens good creatures (1d8 damage/2 levels).

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

You call up unholy power to smite your enemies. The power takes the form of a cold, cloying miasma of greasy darkness. Only good and neutral (not evil) creatures are harmed by the spell.  The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to a good creature (or 1d6 per caster level, maximum 10d6, to a good outsider) and causes it to be sickened for 1d4 rounds. A successful Will save reduces damage to half and negates the sickened effect. The effects cannot be negated by remove disease or heal, but remove curse is effective.  The spell deals only half damage to creatures who are neither evil nor good, and they are not sickened. Such a creature can reduce the damage by half again (down to one-quarter) with a successful Will save.


## (mythic)

The damage dealt to good outsiders increases to 1d10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d10) and the damage dealt to other good creatures increases to 1d12 points of damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d12). The duration that creatures within the area are sickened increases to 2d4 rounds. On a successful save, a good creature is slowed for 1 round.
