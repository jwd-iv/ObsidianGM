You create a crackling lash of unholy lightning that flickers and flashes in your hand like a whip, shifting color in response to your mood and will. Once per round, you can make a melee touch attack with the lightning lash against a target within 15 feet. If the attack is successful, it deals 1d6 points of electricity damage and 1d6 points of damage from divine power (similar to flame strike), and allows you to attempt a trip combat maneuver check as a free action against your target (using your caster level as your CMB).
