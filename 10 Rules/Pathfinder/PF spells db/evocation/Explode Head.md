Brief:: Explode the head of a creature with 20 hp or fewer and deal damage in a 10-ft. radius around it.

```dataviewjs

```

You cause incredible pressure to build in the target's head; this spell works only on a creature that has a head and would die from the loss of a head. The spell kills any such target that has 20 hit points or fewer, exploding its head and spreading debris in a 10-foot radius. Each creature in the area must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or take 2d6 points of slashing damage from the flying debris.
