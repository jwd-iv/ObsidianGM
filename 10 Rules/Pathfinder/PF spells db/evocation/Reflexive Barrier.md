In the blink of an eye, you erect a deflective barrier of force to protect one target. The target gains a deflection bonus to its AC equal to half your caster level. This bonus lasts until the beginning of your next turn. You can cast this spell as a reaction to an attack, but you must do so before the result of the attack is revealed.
