Brief:: Object sheds shadows in 60-ft. radius.

```dataviewjs

```

This spell functions as darkness, except that objects radiate darkness in a 60-foot radius and the light level is lowered by two steps. Bright light becomes dim light and normal light becomes darkness. Areas of dim light and darkness become supernaturally dark. This functions like darkness, but even creatures with darkvision cannot see within the spell's confines. This spell does not stack with itself. Deeper darkness can be used to counter or dispel any light spell of equal or lower spell level.
