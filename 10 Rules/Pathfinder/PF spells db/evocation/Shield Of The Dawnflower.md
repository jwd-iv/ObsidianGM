You create a disk of sunlight on one arm. Any creature that strikes you with a melee attack deals normal damage, but also takes 1d6 points of fire damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15). Creatures with reach weapons are not subject to this damage if they attack you. The shield provides illumination as if it were a continual flame spell. You can only have one instance of this spell in effect at a time. It does not stack with similar damaging aura spells such as fire shield.


## (mythic)

The disk of sunlight protects you as a buckler with a +1enhancement bonus per 4 caster levels (maximum +5).You can make a melee touch attack with your shield of theDawnflower in place of a normal attack to deal its fire damageto a creature. Creatures taking damage from your shield catch onfire (Reflex negates); the save DC to extinguish the fire is equalto the DC of the spell.
