Brief:: Ranged touch attack deals 1d6/level cold damage and 1d4 points of Dexterity drain.

A blue-white ray of freezing air and ice springs from your hand.  You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to deal damage to a target. The ray deals 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 25d6) and 1d4 points of Dexterity drain.


## (mythic)

The damage dealt increases to 1d8 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 25d8) and 1d6 points of Dexterity drain. If the target takes damage from this spell, it becomes partially encased in ice, reducing its speed by half. Creatures with the cold or incorporeal subtypes or immunity to being grappled are immune to this effect. The reduced movement lasts until the ice is destroyed. Destroying the ice requires a successful Strength or dispel check against the spell's DC or dealing 1 point of bludgeoning or fire damage per caster level to the target.
