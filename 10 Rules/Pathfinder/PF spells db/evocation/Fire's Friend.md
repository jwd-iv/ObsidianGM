You cloak yourself in flames that do not harm you or your carried equipment but damage other creatures and objects. The flames cast light as a torch. Any creature that attacks you with a non-reach melee weapon or that begins its turn engaged in a grapple with you takes 1d6 points of fire damage and must succeed at a Reflex save or catch fire. The creature can negate the damage (and avoid catching fire) with spell resistance. Any time you end your movement in the same square as a flammable object or creature, that creature or object must succeed at a Reflex save or catch fire.
