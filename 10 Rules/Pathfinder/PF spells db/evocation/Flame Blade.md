Brief:: Touch attack deals 1d8 + 1/two levels damage.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

A 3-foot-long, blazing beam of red-hot fire springs forth from your hand. You wield this blade-like beam as if it were a scimitar. Attacks with the flame blade are melee touch attacks.  The blade deals 1d8 points of fire damage + 1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10). Since the blade is immaterial, your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage. A flame blade can ignite combustible materials such as parchment, straw, dry sticks, and cloth.


## (mythic)

The blade's damage increases to 2d6 points of fire damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20). The blade threatens a critical hit on a natural 18-20 as if it were an actual scimitar.


### augmented (3rd)

If you expend two uses of mythic power, the blade threatens a critical hit on a natural 15-20, and bypasses hardness, fire resistance, and fire immunity.
