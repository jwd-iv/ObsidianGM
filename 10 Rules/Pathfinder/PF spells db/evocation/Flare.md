Brief:: Dazzles one creature (â€“1 on attack rolls).

```dataviewjs

```

This cantrip creates a burst of light. If you cause the light to burst in front of a single creature, that creature is dazzled for 1 minute unless it makes a successful Fortitude save. Sightless creatures, as well as creatures already dazzled, are not affected by flare.
