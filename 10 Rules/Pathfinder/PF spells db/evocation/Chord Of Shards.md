During your bardic performance, you can strike a chord whose notes transform into a shower of razor sharp, crystalline shards. The shards deal 2d6 points of piercing damage to all creatures caught in the area of effect.


## (mythic)

The damage dealt increases to 2d8 points of piercing damage and bypasses all damage reduction. Any creature damaged by the shards takes 1d8 points of sonic damage.
