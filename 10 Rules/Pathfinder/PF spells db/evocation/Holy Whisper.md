Brief:: Whisper sickens evil creatures, gives good creatures bonuses.

You whisper a single word in the primordial language of good that is anathema to the minions of evil and strengthens the resolve of good creatures. Evil creatures within the burst must make a Fortitude saving throw or become sickened for 1 round/ level. Evil outsiders with the evil subtype, evil-aligned dragons, and undead in the burst also take 2d8 points of damage if they fail their saves. Good-aligned creatures in the burst gain a +2 sacred bonus on attack and damage rolls for 1 round.
