You gain a supernatural ability to detect tracks and other clues left behind by the target. You treat the DCs of all Survival checks made to track the target as if they were 5 lower than normal, and you gain a +5 bonus on Perception checks made to notice the target if it is using Stealth or recognize it if it is using Disguise.
