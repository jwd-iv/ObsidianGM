Brief:: Target takes cold damage and is staggered.

```dataviewjs

```

This spell causes your hand to glow with a pale blue radiance. Your melee touch attack deals 4d6 points of cold damage and causes the target to be staggered for 1 round.  If the attack is a critical hit, the target is staggered for 1 minute instead.
