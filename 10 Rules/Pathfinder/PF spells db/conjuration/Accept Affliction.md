The caster can transfer the effects of afflictions such as curses, diseases, and poisons from the target creature to himself. This spell can also transfer the blinded, deafened, fatigued, nauseated, shaken, and sickened conditions. All aspects of the transferred afflictions (save DCs, remaining duration, removal conditions, and so on) remain the same, but affect the caster instead of the original target. After transferring the affliction or condition, the caster is free to cure it in any way he can.
