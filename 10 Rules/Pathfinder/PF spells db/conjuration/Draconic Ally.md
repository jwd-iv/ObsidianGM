You create a semi-living intelligent draconic servant that loyally obeys and serves you. Treat this servant as a pseudodragon with all of the abilities granted by one of the following spells: form of the alien dragon I, form of the dragon I, or form of the exotic dragon I. Your draconic ally can use its breath weapon once per day. Once conjured, the creature is not limited to the spell's range, and can go a considerable distance to carry out missions at your command. The draconic ally speaks one language of your choice that you know. You cannot have more than one draconic ally at a time. As long as a previous ally exists, you cannot successfully cast  this spell again. If you have a breath weapon, you can cast this spell as a standard action by expending one use of your breath weapon as a free action when you cast the spell.  Clerics, inquisitors, oracles, and warpriests who worship Apsu or Dahak add draconic ally to their spell lists as a 3rd-level spell.
