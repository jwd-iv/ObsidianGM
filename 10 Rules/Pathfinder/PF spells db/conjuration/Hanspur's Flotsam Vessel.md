This spell assembles a sturdy raft and oars from driftwood, reeds, and other river detritus. The smallest raft created by the spell is roughly 5 feet square, increasing by an additional 5 feet square for every 2 caster levels you possess. Each 5-foot section of the raft can carry two Medium passengers or 300 pounds of cargo. The vessel functions as a normal raft, except it is not slowed or damaged by nonmagical river hazards such as rapids or shallows, and it is always considered to be traveling downstream for the purpose of calculating travel speed, regardless of its actual direction.
