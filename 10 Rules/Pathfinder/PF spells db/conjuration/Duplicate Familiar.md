You create a duplicate of a familiar. The familiar's master can use the duplicate as if it were his familiar in all respects, though he doesn't gain the bonus special ability from more  than one familiar at a time. When the spell's duration expires, the familiar duplicate shrivels into nothing, even if petrified or otherwise transformed.
