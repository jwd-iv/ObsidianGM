Brief:: 

You conjure a herd of aurochs or similar herd animal that immediately stampedes in the direction you indicate. The herd takes up a 20-foot-radius space and moves at a rate of 120 feet per round in a straight line. Any creatures caught in the herd's path take 4d6+9 points of damage that round as they are trampled beneath dozens of animals' hooves. A successful Reflex save halves this damage.  If the stampede's path would put it in an obviously dangerous area (such as over a cliff or through a fire) or force it to move through a solid barrier, the herd stops at the obstacle and moves in a new randomly determined direction until it reaches another obstacle or the spell's duration ends.
