Brief:: As reincarnate, but creating a body similar to that of a chosen creature, and you secretly keep part of the body.

```dataviewjs

```

This spell functions as reincarnate except that you can cause the new body to resemble a particular creature, matching its age  category and sex and rerolling any race result that would be the wrong size category. The subject further gains a +5 bonus on Disguise checks to impersonate the chosen creature due to similar features, although it might take a penalty for being the wrong race.  The spell automatically leaves you with a small piece of the creature's new body, typically a lock of hair (useful for scrying and other such spells).
