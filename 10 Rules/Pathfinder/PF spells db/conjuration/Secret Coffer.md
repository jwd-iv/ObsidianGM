Brief:: 

This spell functions like secret chest, except the coffer is only 1 foot square and can contain only 1 cubic foot of goods, and the container can remain safely hidden on the Ethereal Plane for only 14 days before it risks becoming lost. The spell automatically fails if a living creature enters the coffer. The coffer used as a focus for secret coffer must cost at least 500 gp, and its replica costs 5 gp.
