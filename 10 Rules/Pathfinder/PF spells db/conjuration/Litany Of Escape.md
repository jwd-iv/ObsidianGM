Brief:: Teleports a friend out of a grapple.

With a powerful prayer, you call upon the servants of your god to whisk a friend out of a grapple. The target loses the grappled and pinned conditions and is teleported 10 feet. If there is no available space for the target to teleport to, the spell fails.
