Brief:: 

This spell conjures a 30 ft. cone of green slime from the fingertips of the caster. Anyone within the area of effect must make a DC 15 Reflex save or be engulfed in green slime. Engulfed creatures begin to dissolve into green slime. Armor and equipment dissolves in 1d2 rounds. Once armor and clothing dissolve, the victim begins suffering 1d4 points of Con damage per round. When the victim reaches 0 Constitution, he becomes one with the slime. The slime can only be destroyed by a cure disease spell, or by the victim being exposed to 10 points of cold or heat damage.
