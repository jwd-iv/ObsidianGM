Brief:: Summons extraplanar creature to fight for you.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

This spell functions like summon monster I, except that you can summon one creature from the 8th-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 7th-level list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.
