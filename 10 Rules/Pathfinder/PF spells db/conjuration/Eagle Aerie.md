Brief:: Summon 1 giant eagle/3 levels.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

You summon a flight of giant eagles (one per three caster levels, maximum of six; Bestiary 118) to ferry you and your allies across the skies. The eagles avoid combat if possible but defend themselves if attacked; if the eagles attack, the remaining duration of the spell changes from 1 hour per level to 1 round per level (so if the spell had 5 full hours left, the eagles remain in combat for 5 rounds before the spell ends).
