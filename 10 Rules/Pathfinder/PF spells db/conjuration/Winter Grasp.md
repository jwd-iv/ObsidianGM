Brief:: Create a slippery sheet of ice on the ground.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

Ice encrusts the ground, radiating supernatural cold and making it hard for creatures to maintain their balance. This icy ground is treated as normal ice, forcing creatures to spend 2 squares of movement to enter an icy square and increasing the DC of Acrobatics checks in the area by 5. A creature that begins its turn in the affected area takes 1d6 points of cold damage and takes a -2 penalty on saving throws against spells with the cold descriptor for 1 round.
