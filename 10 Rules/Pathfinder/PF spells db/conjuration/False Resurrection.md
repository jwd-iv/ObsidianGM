Brief:: Appear to resurrect someone but instead allow a shadow demon to possess the corpse.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

This spell functions as resurrection except that instead of recalling the dead soul to life, the spell calls a shadow demon with the advanced simple template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 67, 294) to possess the body. If you fail to overcome the subject's spell resistance, the subject's soul can negate the calling and gain the option to return to life (as resurrection) in the restored body. The possession otherwise functions (as possessionOA) except that the subject's soul is not present to resist. When false resurrection ends or the demon is removed from the subject, the demon returns to the Abyss, leaving the body alive but soulless (like that created by clone). If the soul hasn't been returned to life already, it has the option to return in the now-empty body if it still lives (as resurrection). If the body was killed, the demon is sent back to the Abyss but the subject remains dead.  Attempts to identify false resurrection with a skill check incorrectly identify it as resurrection (see the ruse descriptor on page 192). A fooled viewer mistakes false resurrection's aura as the lingering aura of an instantaneous conjuration effect.
