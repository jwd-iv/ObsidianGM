Brief:: Masterwork ice dagger deals +1 cold damage.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

You create a masterwork dagger out of ice. The dagger deals 1 point of cold damage in addition to normal dagger damage.  If the dagger leaves your hand for more than 1 round, it melts and the spell ends. At 6th level, the dagger functions as a +1 frost dagger. At 11th level, it gains the returning property when thrown, melting away and reforming in your hand just before your next turn.
