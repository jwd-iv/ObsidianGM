This spell functions as black tentacles, except the tentacles blindly grasp at the targets' eyes and ears, and tug at their hair, clothes, and equipment. Instead of grapple attempts, the tentacles attempt dirty trick combat maneuver checks (CMB = your caster level + 4 [the tentacles' Strength bonus] + 1 [the tentacles' size bonus]). Roll on the following table to determine the effect of a successful dirty trick combat maneuver check.  d% Effect  1-20 Blinded. The tentacles suction over the victim's eyes.  21-40 Deafened. The tentacles clap themselves around the victim's ears.  41-60 Entangled. The tentacles weave around the victim's limbs.  61-80 Shaken. The tentacles menace the victim from all sides. This is a fear effect.  81-100 Sickened. The tentacles give off sickening vapors. This is a poisonUM effect.
