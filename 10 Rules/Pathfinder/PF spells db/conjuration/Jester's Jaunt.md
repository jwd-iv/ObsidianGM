Brief:: Teleport target within 30 ft. of itself.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

You teleport the target to a space you can see within 30 feet of the target. The destination must be on solid ground, and the teleportation cannot end in a space that is by nature hazardous to the creature you are teleporting.
