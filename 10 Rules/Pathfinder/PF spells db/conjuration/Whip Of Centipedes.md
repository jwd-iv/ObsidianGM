Brief:: Create a whip made of poisonous centipedes.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

This spell functions as whip of spiders, except it summons centipedes, and any creature you strike with the whip takes swarm damage as if it were attacked by a centipede swarm (2d6 points of damage plus poison and distraction, Bestiary 43). If you transform the whip into a centipede swarm, it has 10 hit points.
