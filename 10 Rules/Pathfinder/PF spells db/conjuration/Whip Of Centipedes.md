Brief:: Create a whip made of poisonous centipedes.

This spell functions as whip of spiders, except it summons centipedes, and any creature you strike with the whip takes swarm damage as if it were attacked by a centipede swarm (2d6 points of damage plus poison and distraction, Bestiary 43). If you transform the whip into a centipede swarm, it has 10 hit points.
