Brief:: Black particles extinguish light sources.

A shower of iridescent black particles clings to and extinguishes torches, lanterns, sunrods, and similar mundane light sources and dispels any spell of 2nd level or lower with the light descriptor (as dispel magic). Creatures in the area must make a Fortitude save or become fatigued.


## (mythic)

A creature that fails its Fortitude save against the spell must also succeed at a Will save at the same DC or fall asleep (as the sleep spell). Creatures that succeed at their saves are merely drowsy (as the lullaby spell).


### augmented

If you expend two uses of mythic power, add half your tier to the level of light spells mythic dust of twilight dispels.
