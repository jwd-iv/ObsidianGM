Brief:: As teleport, but affects a touched object.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

This spell functions like teleport, except that it teleports an object, not you. Creatures and magical forces cannot be teleported.  If desired, the target object can be sent to a distant location on the Ethereal Plane. In this case, the point from which the object was teleported remains faintly magical until the item is retrieved. A successful targeted dispel magic spell cast on that point brings the vanished item back from the Ethereal Plane.
