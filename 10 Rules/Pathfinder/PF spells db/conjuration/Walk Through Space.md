Brief:: You can spend a move action to teleport 30 feet or to stand while prone without provoking attacks of opportunity.

```

When under the effects of this spell, you can teleport up to 30 feet as a move action. You must end this movement in an unoccupied space that you can stand on within line of sight. Alternatively, you can spend a move action to teleport to a standing position from lying prone. Teleporting does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
