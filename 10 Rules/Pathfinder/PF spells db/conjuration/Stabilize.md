Brief:: Cause a dying creature to stabilize.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

Upon casting this spell, you target a living creature that has -1 or fewer hit points. That creature is automatically stabilized and does not lose any further hit points. If the creature later takes damage, it continues dying normally.
