Brief:: As many as 8 subjects travel to another plane.

You move yourself or some other creature to another plane of existence or alternate dimension. If several willing persons link hands in a circle, as many as eight can be affected by the plane shift at the same time. Precise accuracy as to a particular arrival location on the intended plane is nigh impossible. From the Material Plane, you can reach any other plane, though you appear 5 to 500 miles (5d%) from your intended destination. Plane shift transports creatures instantaneously and then ends. The creatures need to find other means if they are to travel back (including casting plane shift again).


## (mythic)

If you've been to the destination plane and are familiar with a location there, you may choose that location and arrive on target at that location with anyone else you transport with the spell.


### augmented

If you expend two uses of mythic power, you grant transported creatures the effects of a planar adaptation spell (Advanced Player's Guide 236) upon arrival, lasting for 1 hour.
