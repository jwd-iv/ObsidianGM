You conjure a supernaturally vicious and clever crow to watch over you on the battlefield. Choose one of the following templates; the crow has that template and this spell gains the descriptor listed in parentheses: celestial (good), entropicB2 (chaotic), fiendish (evil), or resoluteB2 (lawful). In addition to its normal abilities, the crow gains the Improved StealAPG feat  as a bonus feat and gains an eye rake attack. If both of its claw attacks hit the same living foe in a single round, that foe must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex save or be blinded as the bird scratches and tears at the foe's eyes. The blindness lasts for 1d4 days or until healed with remove blindness.  If the focus leaves your possession, the crow vanishes and the spell ends.
