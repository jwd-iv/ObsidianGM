Brief:: (Evil creatures only.) Summons extraplanar creature to fight for you.

This spell functions like summon monster I, except that you can summon one creature from the 4th-level list, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the 3rd-level list, or 1d4+1 creatures of the same kind from a lower-level list.
