You call the spirits of two ancestors to manifest in the mortal world and attack your enemies. Each appears as a transparent image of a powerful, wise dwarf armed with a traditional dwarven weapon of your choice. These spirits move and attack at your direction, each having the abilities of a spiritual weapon, except they can attack different targets and deal physical damage (bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing, according to the weapon the spirit wields) instead of force damage. Like creatures conjured with a summon monster spell, your ancestors are not harmed if these manifestations are destroyed.
