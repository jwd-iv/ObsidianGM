Brief:: Magical field grants a +1 bonus to AC and on saves, and stuns one creature attacking you.

```dataviewjs

```

You are closely surrounded by a barely visible magical field.  The field provides a +1 deflection bonus to AC and a +1 resistance bonus on saves. Any creature that strikes you with a melee attack is stunned for 1 round (Will negates). Once the field has stunned an opponent, the spell is discharged.
