Brief:: Opponents cannot attack a pathetic creature.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

This spell functions as sanctuary, except creatures attempting to attack the target who fail their saves also feel a strong sense of pity toward the target, as if it were weak, pathetic, and not a threat. If the target breaks the spell by attacking, any creature that failed its save against the spell gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls against the target for 1 minute.
