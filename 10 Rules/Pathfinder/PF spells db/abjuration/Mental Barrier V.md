Brief:: As mental barrier III, plus 50% chance to prevent critical hits and sneak attacks.

This functions as mental barrier III, but if you are struck by a critical hit or sneak attack, there is a 50% chance that the additional damage is negated (as moderate fortification). This does not stack with similar effects that negate the additional damage from a critical hit or sneak attack. In addition, you are immune to mind thrust I, II, and III, and you take half damage from mind thrust IV, V, and VI (reduced to one-quarter on a successful Will save). This spell can be undercast.
