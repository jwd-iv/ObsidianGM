Brief:: Holds door shut.

This spell magically holds shut a door, gate, window, or shutter of wood, metal, or stone. The magic affects the portal just as if it were securely closed and normally locked. A knock spell or a successful dispel magic spell can negate a hold portal spell.  Add 5 to the normal DC for forcing open a portal affected by this spell.


## (mythic)

The target portal can be as large as 30 square feet per caster level. A creature attempting to force open the portal must first succeed at a Will save against the spell's DC. This is a mind-affecting effect. Failure means the creature can't open the door while the spell is in effect.
