Brief:: As mental barrier I, but +8 to AC.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

This spell functions as mental barrier I, but the shield bonus to AC increases to +8. In addition, you are immune to mine thrust I, and you take half damage from mind thrust II, III, and IV (reduced to one-quarter on a successful Will save). This spell can be undercast.
