Brief:: +1 AC/four levels (max +5).

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

You imbue your armor with a righteous aura. It gains a +1 enhancement bonus per four caster levels (maximum +5 at 20th level). When using your judgment or smite ability, you gain DR 5/evil.  An outfit of regular clothing counts as armor that grants no AC bonus for the purpose of this spell.


## (mythic)

You gain DR 5/evil while wearing the target armor. While you're using your judgment or smite ability, this improves to DR 10/evil.


### augmented (3rd)

If you expend two uses of mythic power, when you use judgment or smite, add half your tier to your AC as a sacred bonus.
