Brief:: Inscription casts your hex or major hex on those who pass it.

This spell functions as hex glyph, except you can store a hex or a major hex (but not a grand hex). You trace the glyph with incense, which must first be sprinkled with powdered diamond (as noted in the material line).  Read magic allows its caster to identify a greater hex glyph with a DC 16 Spellcraft check.
