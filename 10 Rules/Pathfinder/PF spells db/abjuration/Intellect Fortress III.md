Brief:: As intellect fortress II, plus remove partial effects of fear and emotion effects.

This spell functions as intellect fortress II, but creatures within the area who succeed at a saving throw against a fear or emotion effect suffer no effects, even if there is usually a partial effect on a successful saving throw. This spell can be undercast.
