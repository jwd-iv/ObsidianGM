Brief:: Locks a weapon in place on the target's body.

```dataviewjs

```

You lock a weapon in place on its owner's body, or within the weapon's sheath or holster. Anyone who then tries to draw the weapon must spend a standard action and succeed at a Strength check (DC equal to the saving throw DC) to do so, provoking attacks of opportunity whether the attempt succeeds or fails.
