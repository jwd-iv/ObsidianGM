Anytime a harmless (so noted by a spell's saving throw description) spell of 3rd level or lower is cast within a covetous aura's area of effect, you may choose to immediately gain the benefit of that spell as if it had also targeted you. The intended target still gains the effect of the spell. You gain the benefits of this duplicated spell only if the caster is in range of the covetous aura. You are considered the caster of the additional spell effect. If the effect allows for multiple targets other than yourself, you cannot use the stolen spell effect to target other creatures-a covetous aura only aids you. Once you choose to gain the benefit of another spell, the covetous aura immediately ends. Rumors hold that this unusual spell was invented thousands of years ago by Runelord Belimarius, who was constantly jealous of other spellcasters' abilities.


## (mythic)

The duration of the covetous aura increases to 1 minute perlevel or until discharged. You may gain the benefits of spells of5th level or lower cast within the aura's area of effect. You cangain the effects of two separate spells, after which the mythiccovetous aura ends.


### augmented (6th)

If you expend two uses of mythicpower, the duration increases to 10 minutes per level or untildischarged. You may gain the benefits of spells of 7th level orlower cast within the aura's area of effect. When you gain thebenefit of a spell, the original spell is immediately targeted witha greater dispel magic spell at your caster level. If the dispelcheck succeeds, the spell ends for any of the original recipientsin the area of your covetous aura.
