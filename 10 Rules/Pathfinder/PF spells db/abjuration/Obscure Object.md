Brief:: Masks object against scrying.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

This spell hides an object from location by divination (scrying) effects, such as the scrying spell or a crystal ball. Such an attempt automatically fails (if the divination is targeted on the object) or fails to perceive the object (if the divination is targeted on a nearby location, object, or person).
