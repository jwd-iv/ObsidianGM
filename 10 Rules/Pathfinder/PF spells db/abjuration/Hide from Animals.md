Brief:: Animals canâ€™t perceive one subject/level.

```dataviewjs

```

Animals cannot sense the warded creatures. Even extraordinary or supernatural sensory capabilities, such as blindsense, blindsight, scent, and tremorsense, cannot detect or locate warded creatures.  Animals simply act as though the warded creatures are not there.  If a warded character touches an animal or attacks any creature, even with a spell, the spell ends for all recipients.
