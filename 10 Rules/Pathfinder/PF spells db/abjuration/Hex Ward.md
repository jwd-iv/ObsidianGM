Brief:: Target gains +4 on saves against witch hexes.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

You give the target a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws against witch hexes.


## (mythic)

The target gains immunity to one witch hex (but not a major hex or grand hex) of your choice.


### augmented (3rd)

If you expend two uses of mythic power, instead of granting immunity to one witch hex, you can grant immunity to two hexes or one major hex. If you're at least 6th tier and expend three uses of mythic power, you instead grant immunity to three hexes, two major hexes, or one grand hex.
