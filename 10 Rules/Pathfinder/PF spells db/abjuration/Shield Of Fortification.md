Brief:: Target gains a 25% chance to treat critical hits and sneak attacks as normal hits.

```dataviewjs

You create a magical barrier that protects a target's vital areas. When the target is struck by a critical hit or a sneak attack, there is a 25% chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally.  This benefit does not stack with other effects that can turn critical hits or sneak attacks into normal attacks, such as the fortification armor special ability.
