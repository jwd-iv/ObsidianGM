Brief:: As thought shield III, but stun for 1d4 rounds and resist psychic crush spells.

```dataviewjs

```

This functions as thought shield III, but any creature that tries to read your thoughts while this spell lasts must succeed at a Will save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. Additionally, if you succeed at your save against a psychic crush spell, you take no damage. This spell can be undercast.
