Brief:: As mental barrier I, but +6 to AC.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

This spell functions as mental barrier I, but the shield bonus to AC increases to +6. In addition, you take half damage from mind thrust I, II, and III (reduced to one-quarter on a successful Will save). This spell can be undercast.
