Brief:: As sealed life, plus death ward and immunity to soul transference.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

This spell functions as sealed life, except it additionally provides the benefits of death ward and renders its targets immune to effects that extract or transfer its soul, such as possession and trap the soul. This spell prevents a soul from returning to its body if it has already departed, until the spell's duration expires.
