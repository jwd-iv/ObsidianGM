Brief:: As protection from arrows, but you may divide the duration among creatures touched.

```dataviewjs

```

This spell functions like protection from arrows, except you divide the duration in 1-hour intervals among the creatures touched. Once the spell absorbs 10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 100 points) for a subject, the spell's effects end for that subject.
