Brief:: Suppresses fear or gives +4 on saves against fear for one subject + one per four levels.

```dataviewjs

```

You instill courage in the subject, granting it a +4 morale bonus against fear effects for 10 minutes. If the subject is under the influence of a fear effect when receiving the spell, that effect is suppressed for the duration of the spell.  Remove fear counters and dispels cause fear.
