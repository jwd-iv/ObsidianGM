Brief:: Removes polymorph effects.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

True form removes any polymorph effect from a target creature, returning it to its true form, even against its will. Against creatures affected by polymorph spell effects (such as baleful polymorph or giant form), you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect. Success means that the polymorph immediately ends.  A creature with the supernatural ability to change shape (such as a lycanthrope) must make a Will saving throw or immediately revert to its true form. If it fails this first saving throw, the creature can attempt another Will saving throw to overcome the spell as a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If this save succeeds, the spell ends and the creature is capable of changing shape once again. If the second save fails, the creature is locked in its true form for the duration of the spell, preventing any further polymorph effects from changing its shape.


## (mythic)

The spell's target changes to up to one creature per 2 caster levels. If a target is a creature that has the ability to change shape between a specific set of forms (such as a barghest or lycanthrope), you may choose which form the creature takes. To force such a creature into a form, you must have either seen it in that form or succeeded at an appropriate Knowledge check to know the creature has the ability to take that form.


### augmented (6th)

If you expend three uses of mythic power, the spell creates an area affecting all shapechanging creatures. The range changes to 30 feet and the spell affects all creatures in a 30-foot radius around you. Each creature must attempt a saving throw against the spell every round it remains in the area.
