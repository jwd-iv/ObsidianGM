Brief:: 

You emit a calming subsonic drone that allows the targets to temporarily refocus and restore their balance when they're suffering from debilitating conditions. A target with the dazzled, fatigued, shaken, or sickened condition ignores the penalties of those conditions for the duration of this spell. A target with one of the following conditions is treated as having the associated lesser condition for the duration of the spell, as shown by the following table. Condition Lesser Condition Blinded Dazzled Exhausted Fatigued Frightened Shaken Nauseated Sickened At the end of the spell's duration, the targets are again subject to the appropriate penalties if the original conditions affecting the target are still in effect.
