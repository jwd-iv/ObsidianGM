Brief:: Prevent a creature from transferring life force to or from others.

```dataviewjs

```

You seal the life force within the target, preventing it from sharing its vitality with others. Affected creatures can't transfer damage to or from another, such as through shield other, a spiritualist's life bond, or a summoner's life link. Effects such as vampiric touch that steal vitality from others deal damage normally, but provide no benefits.
