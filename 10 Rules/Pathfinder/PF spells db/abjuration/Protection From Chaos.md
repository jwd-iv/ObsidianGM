Brief:: +2 to AC and saves, plus additional protection against selected alignment.

```

This spell functions like protection from evil, except that the deflection and resistance bonuses apply to attacks made by chaotic creatures. The target receives a new saving throw against control by chaotic creatures and chaotic summoned creatures cannot touch the target.


## (mythic)

The bonuses to AC and on saves increase to +4. Any chaotic creature attempting to possess or exercise mental control over the target must attempt a Will save against this spell. If it fails, the creature takes 1d6 points of damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d6) from mental feedback. A chaotic creature that uses spell resistance to bypass the spell's protection against contact must successfully save or take this damage once each round it attacks the protected target.
