Brief:: As thought shield I, but +8 on Will saves and stun creatures that read your thoughts for 1 round.

```dataviewjs

```

This functions as thought shield I, but the circumstance bonus on Will saves to resist mind-affecting effects increases to +8. In addition, any creature that tries to read your thoughts while this spell lasts must succeed at a Will save or be stunned for 1 round. This spell can be undercast.
