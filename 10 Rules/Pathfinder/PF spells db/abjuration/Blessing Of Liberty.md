Brief:: 

You imbue yourself with the blessings of liberty. You gain a +1 luck bonus per 6 caster levels (minimum +1, maximum +3) to  your CMD and on saving throws against spells and traps that would move you or impede your movement. You can end the spell's effects as a swift action to gain a +20 foot enhancement bonus to your base speed for 1 round per whole minute of duration remaining.
