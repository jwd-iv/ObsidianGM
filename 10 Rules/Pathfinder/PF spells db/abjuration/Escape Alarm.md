You place a ward on an area that notifies you when a creature exits it. This functions as alarm, except as noted. It alerts you when a creature leaves, rather than enters, the area, and you can't select a password to bypass its effects. Instead, when you place an escape alarm, you can attune up to one additional creature per caster level to the spell. You are automatically attuned to your own escape alarm and don't count against the limit. Attuned creatures can enter and exit the spell's area without triggering the alarm. If you select a mental alarm rather than an audible one, all attuned creatures receive the mental alert when someone exits the warded area.
