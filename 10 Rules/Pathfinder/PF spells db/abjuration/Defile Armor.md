As sanctify armor, except you gain DR 5/good when using your judgment or smite ability.


## (mythic)

You gain DR 5/good while wearing the target armor. While using your judgment or smite ability, this improves to DR 10/good.


### augmented (3rd)

If you expend two uses of mythic power, while you use your judgment or smite, add half your tier to your AC as a profane bonus.
