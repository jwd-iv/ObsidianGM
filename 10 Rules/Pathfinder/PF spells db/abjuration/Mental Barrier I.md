Brief:: Gain a +4 shield bonus to AC and resist mind thrust for 1 round as an immediate action.

```dataviewjs

```

You put a barrier of mental energy that protects you from harm. This barrier grants you a +4 shield bonus to AC. In addition, you take half damage from mind thrust I and II (reduced to one-quarter on a successful Will save).
