You create a magical field around summoned creatures you control that deflects attacks made against them. The targets gain a deflection bonus to their AC equal to 1 + 1 for every 6 caster levels you possess (maximum +4 deflection bonus at 18th level). A summoner can target his eidolon with this spell.
