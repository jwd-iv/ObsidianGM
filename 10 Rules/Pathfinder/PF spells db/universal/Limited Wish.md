A limited wish lets you create nearly any type of effect. For example, a limited wish can do any of the following things.  • Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell does not belong to one of your opposition schools.  • Duplicate any non-sorcerer/wizard spell of 5th level or lower, provided the spell does not belong to one of your opposition schools.  • Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 5th level or lower, even if it belongs to one of your opposition schools.  • Duplicate any non-sorcerer/wizard spell of 4th level or lower, even if it belongs to one of your opposition schools.  • Undo the harmful effects of many spells, such as geas/quest or insanity.  • Produce any other effect whose power level is in line with the above effects, such as a single creature automatically hitting on its next attack or taking a -7 penalty on its next saving throw.  A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the save DC is for a 7th-level spell. When a limited wish spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 1,000 gp, you must provide that component (in addition to the 1,500 gp diamond component for this spell).
