Brief:: As mind thrust II, but a maximum of 15d8 points of damage and target is fatigued for 1 round.

```dataviewjs

```

This functions as mind thrust I, but the target takes 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d8) and is fatigued for 1 round if it fails its save. This spell can be undercast.
