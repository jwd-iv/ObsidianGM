Brief:: Gain cryptic information from further in the future than divination.

You glimpse the future. Prognostication functions as divination except that the spell can see up to a year and a day into the future. Because of the increased unpredictability of the distant future, prognostication is significantly more cryptic than the already-cryptic divination spell.
