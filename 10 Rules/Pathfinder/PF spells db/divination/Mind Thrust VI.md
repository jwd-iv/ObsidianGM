Brief:: As mind thrust IV, but maximum 20d8 points of damage and target is exhausted and stunned for 1 round.

This functions as mind thrust IV, but the target takes 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d8) and is exhausted and stunned for 1 round if it fails its save. This spell can be undercast.
