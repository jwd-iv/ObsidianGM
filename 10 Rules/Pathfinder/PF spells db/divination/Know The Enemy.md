Brief:: Gain +10 on a monster Knowledge check.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

You commune with the divine, reflecting on one type of creature you encountered in the last day. You may make a Knowledge check regarding that creature type with a +10 insight bonus.


## (mythic)

The insight bonus increases to +15 plus your tier. If the check is successful, you gain a +5 insight bonus on your next attack roll or saving throw against a creature of that type, as long as the roll occurs within 24 hours of casting the spell.
