Brief:: Target is permanently shaken and sickened, and may gain a spellblight.

```

You wrack the target's body and mind with the anguish and suffering of every bitter failure it will ever experience, rendering it permanently shaken and sickened. A successful Will save reduces the duration to 1 round per level. If the target is a spellcaster, failing this saving throw means it also gains a random minor spellblight (see page 95).
