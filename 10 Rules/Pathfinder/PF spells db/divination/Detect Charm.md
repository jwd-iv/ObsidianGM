This spell functions as per detect magic, except that it detects only charm, compulsion, and possession effects. You immediately detect the strength and location of each such aura on all creatures in the area. You can attempt to identify the properties of each aura (see Spellcraft on page 106 the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). In addition to noticing the targets of these effects, you can recognize when creatures in the area are using these effects on others by attempting a Sense Motive check as a standard action (DC = 20 + caster level). If you succeed, you can attempt a Spellcraft check to identify what magic it is using (even if the target is not in the area).
