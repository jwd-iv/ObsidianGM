You pull forth idealized versions of yourself at various ages from your mind, splitting into three copies of yourself. Threefold form functions as bilocation (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 158), except there are three of you instead of two, and each of the three bodies is under the effect of threefold aspectAPG with a different idealized age. Other than the differences from threefold aspect, each body shares all other effects with you, as normal for bilocation.
