By rearranging the threads of fate, you disrupt fortunate outcomes for other creatures. A creature affected by this spell is unable to benefit from effects that grant the ability to roll multiple times and take the higher result (like the swashbuckler's charmed life ability) or to choose the die result in lieu of rolling (like the wizard's prescience school power or the cyclops's flash of insight ability). This doesn't affect abilities that force a creature to take the lower of two rolls, such as ill omen or a pugwampi's unluck aura (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 144). A cyclops can't use its flash of insight ability to save against this spell.
