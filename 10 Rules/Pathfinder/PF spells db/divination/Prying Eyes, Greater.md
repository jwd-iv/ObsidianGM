Brief:: As prying eyes, but eyes have true seeing.

This spell functions like prying eyes, except that the eyes can see all things as they actually are, just as if they had true seeing with a range of 120 feet. Thus, they can navigate darkened areas at normal speed. Also, a greater prying eye's maximum Perception modifier is +25 instead of +15.
