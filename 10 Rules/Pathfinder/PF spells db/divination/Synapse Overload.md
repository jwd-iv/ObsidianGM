Brief:: Deal 1d6 points of damage per level and stagger target for 1 minute.

You cause the target's mind to unleash a vast overflowing torrent of information throughout the target's body, causing the target's synapses to violently trigger. The target takes 1d6 points of electrical damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) and is staggered for 1 minute. A successful Fortitude saving throw doesn't reduce the damage, but it negates the staggered effect.
