Brief:: You roll damage twice when you roll damage for a critical hit and take the best damage.

You can sense your foes' weak points, granting you greater damage with critical hits. Whenever you score a critical hit, roll the attack's damage dice (but not extra or precision damage dice) twice and take the highest result.
