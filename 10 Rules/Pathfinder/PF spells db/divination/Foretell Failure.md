Brief:: 

You cast this spell immediately before you would take an action that requires a d20 roll, such as a skill check, attack roll, or ability check. The action must be something you can complete in a single round. The spell magically informs you whether the action will succeed if you roll a 10 or better on the d20 roll involved. If the action would be successful under those circumstances, you must take the action. If the action would not be successful, you can take a different action.
