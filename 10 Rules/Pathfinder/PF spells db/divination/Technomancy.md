This spell functions as detect magic, except it detects the presence of technological objects instead of magical objects. The spell grants you the Technologist feat for the purposes of attempting Knowledge (engineering) checks to identify the properties of technological items in your possession. If you already possess this feat, you gain a +10 bonus on Knowledge (engineering) checks to identify item properties.
