Brief:: Share one memory with the target.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

You momentarily link your mind with the target and share a single memory of no longer than 1 minute. You can show the target one of your memories, show the target one of its own memories, or view one of the target's memories.
