When faced with an important situation, you grant yourself a magical edge to ensure your success. When casting this spell, select one skill for which you can attempt a skill check. The next time you attempt a skill check using the selected skill (before the spell's duration ends), you gain an insight bonus on the check equal to 1/2 your caster level (minimum 1).
