Brief:: Creatures are shaken and take Wis damage.

```dataviewjs

```

An illusion of misty vapor inhabited by shadowy shapes arises around you. It is stationary. The illusory mist obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance).  Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target).  All creatures within the mist must save or take 1d2 points of Wisdom damage and gain the shaken condition. The shaken condition lasts as long as the creature remains in the mist.
