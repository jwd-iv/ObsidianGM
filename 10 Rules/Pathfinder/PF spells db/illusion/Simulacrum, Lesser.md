Brief:: Creates a double of a weak creature.

```dataviewjs

```

This spell functions as simulacrum, except you can't create a simulacrum of a creature whose HD or levels exceed your caster level, and it has no magical abilities. The creature is not under your control, though it recognizes you are its creator.
