The spell weaves shadows and colors from your kapenia into the shape of legendary characters from Varisian folktales.  This spell functions as shadow conjuration emulating summon monster I, except as noted here. You can summon only one copy of the same character at the same time, even with multiple castings of this spell. The shadow creatures are 40% real and are drawn from the list below.
