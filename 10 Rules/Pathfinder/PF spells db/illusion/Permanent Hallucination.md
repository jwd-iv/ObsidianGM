Brief:: As scripted hallucination, but permanent.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

This spell functions as audiovisual hallucination (see page 204), except that the phantasm you create includes visual, auditory, olfactory, tactile, and thermal components, and the phantasm follows a complex script. The phantasm follows that script without your having to concentrate on it and can react to stimuli the target perceives, as appropriate for the script. Unlike most illusions with a save to disbelieve, if the target disbelieves a permanent hallucination, she can choose to end the effect entirely at any time.
