Brief:: Target takes penalties to mental actions.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

This spell induces a hallucinogenic reality in the mind of your target. Surfaces seem to swim, and movement constantly distracts the eye. The target takes a -2 penalty on Will saving throws, caster level checks, Intelligence-based skill checks, and Wisdom-based skill checks.
