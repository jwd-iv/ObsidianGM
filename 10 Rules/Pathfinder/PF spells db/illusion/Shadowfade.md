In areas of darkness, the target of shadowfade is invisible to creatures using darkvision to see. In areas of dim light, the target gains concealment against creatures using darkvision. This spell has no effect in areas of normal light or brighter, and is automatically dispelled if the target enters an area of bright light or takes a hostile action.
