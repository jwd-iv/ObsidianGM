Brief:: As create mindscape, but affecting more creatures, having a longer duration, and allowing magic alteration.

This spell functions like create mindscape, except it can affect more creatures, the mindscape lasts longer, and you can choose the mindscape's magic trait. You can also direct a number of believable creatures at a time equal to your caster level.  Greater create mindscape can be made permanent with a permanency spell by a caster of 15th level or higher at a cost of 17,500 gp. You and other creatures aware of a permanent mindscape can come and go using the mindscape door spell.
