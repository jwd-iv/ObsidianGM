Brief:: Creates minor illusion of your design.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

This spell creates the visual illusion of an object, creature, or force, as visualized by you. The illusion does not create sound, smell, texture, or temperature. You can move the image within the limits of the size of the effect.


## (mythic)

The duration increases to concentration + 1 round per caster level, and the effect increases to a visual figment that can't extend beyond eight 10-foot cubes + 1 10-foot cube per caster level.


### augmented (6th)

If you expend two uses of mythic power, the duration changes to concentration + 1 minute per caster level and the effect changes to a visual figment no larger than a 50-foot emanation. An augmented mythic silent image can't move.
