Brief:: Knocks unconscious, blinds, and/or stuns weak creatures.

```dataviewjs

```

A vivid cone of clashing colors springs forth from your hand, causing creatures to become stunned, perhaps also blinded, and possibly knocking them unconscious. Each creature within the cone is affected according to its HD.  2 HD or less: The creature is unconscious, blinded, and stunned for 2d4 rounds, then blinded and stunned for 1d4 rounds, and then stunned for 1 round. (Only living creatures are knocked unconscious.) 3 or 4 HD: The creature is blinded and stunned for 1d4 rounds, then stunned for 1 round.  5 or more HD: The creature is stunned for 1 round.  Sightless creatures are not affected by color spray.


## (mythic)

The range increases to 30 feet. Add half your tier to the spell's Hit Dice categories to determine its effects on creatures. (At 3rd tier a creature with 3 or fewer HD is unconscious, blinded, and stunned; one with 4 or 5 HD is blinded and stunned, and one with 6 or more HD is stunned.) Creatures that succeed at their saves are dazzled for 1 minute.
