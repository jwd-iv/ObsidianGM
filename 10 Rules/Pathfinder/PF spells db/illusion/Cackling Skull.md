Brief:: Skull acts as magic mouth, listeners are shaken.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

This spell functions as magic mouth, except rather than creating an illusory mouth on any surface, it affects a skull.  In addition, when the skull's magic is triggered, it releases wild and unnerving cackles before speaking its message.  All creatures that can hear the cackles must save or become shaken for 1d4 rounds.
