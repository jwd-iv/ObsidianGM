Brief:: Enemies take â€“1 on attack rolls and saves vs. fear.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

Bane fills your enemies with fear and doubt. Each affected creature takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls and a -1 penalty on saving throws against fear effects. Bane counters and dispels bless.


## (mythic)

The -1 penalty applies on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and all saving throws. Each affected creature must roll its next attack roll or saving throw twice and take the lower result.
