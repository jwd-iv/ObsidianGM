Brief:: Redirect an enemy creature's attack.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

Cast this spell when an enemy is about to make an attack against an ally. The creature makes the attack against a valid target of your choice instead or the attack is negated.  In addition, the target is considered an ally for determining flanking for 1 round.
