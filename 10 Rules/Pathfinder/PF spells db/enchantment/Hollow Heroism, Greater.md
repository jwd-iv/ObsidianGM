Brief:: Provide a greater heroism effect that you can reverse at any time.

This spell functions as greater heroism, except that you can reverse the spell by issuing a special command as a standard action if you are within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per caster level) of the target. The target loses the bonuses and instead takes a -4 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks until the spell's duration ends (no save), increasing to a -8 penalty against fear effects. Additionally, she takes damage equal to your caster level when you reverse the spell.  Attempts to identify greater hollow heroism with a skill check incorrectly identify it as greater heroism (see the ruse descriptor on page 192).
