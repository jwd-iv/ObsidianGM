Brief:: 

You are transformed into a single-minded force of destruction. You gain the ferocity monster special ability, a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d6 + your caster level (maximum +10), and a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects. You cannot use the withdraw action or willingly move away from a creature that has attacked you.  When you use this spell, you immediately take 4 points of Intelligence damage. You must make a DC 20 concentration check to cast spells, and all other concentration checks to cast spells have a -5 penalty.


## (mythic)

The number of temporary hit points you gain increases to 2d6 + your caster level (maximum +10) + your tier. The morale bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects increases to +6.


### augmented (5th)

If you expend two uses of mythic power, you gain a +4 morale bonus to Strength, immunity to non-mythic mind-affecting effects, and DR 5/epic.
