Brief:: Allies get +1 bonus on most rolls, enemies â€“1 penalty.

```dataviewjs

```

You bring special favor upon yourself and your allies while bringing disfavor to your enemies. You and each of your allies gain a +1 luck bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saves, and skill checks, while each of your foes takes a -1 penalty on such rolls.


## (mythic)

The spell's luck bonus increases to +2, and the penalty for enemies changes to -2. When you cast the spell, your affected allies heal an amount of hit point damage equal to double your tier, and affected enemies take an amount of damage equal to double your tier.
