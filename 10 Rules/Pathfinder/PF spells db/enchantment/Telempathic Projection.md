Brief:: Alter the targetâ€™s attitude or give bonuses to those interacting with the target.

```

You alter the target's mood, adjusting its attitude toward you or another creature you designate by one step either positively or negatively (see the Diplomacy skill on page 94 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). You can instead use this spell to assist your own or an ally's Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, Perform, or Sense Motive check, granting that check a +5 insight bonus against the target of your telempathic projection with no save. In this case, the spell's duration expires immediately when the skill check is complete.
