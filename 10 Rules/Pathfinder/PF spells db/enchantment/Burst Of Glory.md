Brief:: 

Allies in the area of this spell at the time of casting gain a +1 sacred bonus on attack rolls and saves against fear effects, plus 1 temporary hit point per caster level (maximum 20). You shine with a white or golden radiance equal to a torch for the spell's duration, though you can dismiss the glow effect as a free action.
