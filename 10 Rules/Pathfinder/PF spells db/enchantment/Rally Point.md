Brief:: Square gives good creatures bonuses.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

You create a spot that has the power to briefly hearten any good creature who comes into contact with it. A good creature who enters this square (even if simply as part of its normal move) gains a +2 morale bonus on attacks, saving throws, and 2 temporary hit points per caster level for 1 round. Nongood creatures gain no benefit from this spell.  A creature cannot benefit more than once from the same casting of this spell.
