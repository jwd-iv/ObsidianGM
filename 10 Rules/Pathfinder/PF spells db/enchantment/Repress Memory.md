Brief:: Remove a piece of knowledge from your mind.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

This spell allows you to safeguard important knowledge, even from yourself. When casting this spell, you recount one piece of knowledge you possess (up to a maximum of 50 words). This knowledge disappears utterly from your mind, and you might not realize you forgot something. The magic of the spell patches omissions in your memory with indistinct haze  Repress memory protects against detect thoughts, discern lies, zone of truth, and similar spells, though careful questioning may reveal the gaps in your memory, or that your memory has been affected by the spell.  A repressed memory can be restored only by break enchantment, psychic surgery, limited wish, miracle, or wish. If you use this spell to negate the memory of a magical compulsion, it doesn't remove the compulsion, nor does it remove procedural memories that might affect your skills or class abilities.  At the GM's discretion, multiple castings of this spell might erase memories of a lengthier event or all memory of a place or individual from your memory.
