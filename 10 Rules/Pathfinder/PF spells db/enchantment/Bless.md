Brief:: Allies gain +1 on attack rolls and saves against fear.

```dataviewjs

```

Bless fills your allies with courage. Each ally gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and on saving throws against fear effects.  Bless counters and dispels bane.


## (mythic)

The +1 morale bonus applies on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and all saving throws. Once during the spell's duration, an affected creature can roll an attack roll or saving throw twice and take the higher result. The target must decide to use this ability before the first roll is attempted.
