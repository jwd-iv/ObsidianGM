You gain a bonus on Charisma-based skill checks equal to 1 + 1 for every 4 caster levels you possess (to a maximum of +5), but only when interacting with those who might conceivably find you sexually attractive. You do not gain this bonus against those you or your allies are attacking or threatening.
