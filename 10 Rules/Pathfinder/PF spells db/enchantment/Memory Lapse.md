Brief:: Subject forgets events back to last turn.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

You cause the target to forget what happened from the casting of the spell back to the beginning of its last turn. This may allow a retry on a Diplomacy, Intimidate, or opposed skill check, though only with respect to the target, not other creatures that may be present.
