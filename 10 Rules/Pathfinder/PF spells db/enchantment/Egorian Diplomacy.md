As part of casting this spell, you can attempt a single Intimidate skill check to make a target act friendly toward you. If you succeed, the target assists you normally, but Egorian diplomacy clouds the memory of any threats or pressure you applied. The target remembers assisting you, but can't remember why, and its attitude toward you doesn't worsen as a result of being intimidated.  Whether a creature fails or succeeds at its saving throw, it becomes immune to further castings of Egorian diplomacy for 24 hours.
