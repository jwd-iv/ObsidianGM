Brief:: Send messages as per message with one suggestion for each creature.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

This spell functions as demanding message, except that you can issue one suggestion to each of the spell's targets instead of just one. Each time you do so, it takes a standard action. You can issue a different suggestion to each target.
