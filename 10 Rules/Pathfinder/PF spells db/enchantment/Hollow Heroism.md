Brief:: Provide a heroism effect that you can reverse at any time.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

This spell functions as heroism, except that you can reverse the spell by issuing a special command as a standard action if you are within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per caster level) of the target. The target loses the bonuses and instead takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks until the spell's duration ends (no save).  Attempts to identify hollow heroism with a skill check incorrectly identify it as heroism (see the ruse descriptor on page 192).
