Brief:: Triggered rune puts nearby creatures into catatonic slumber.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

This spell functions like symbol of death, except that all creatures of 10 HD or less within 60 feet of the symbol of sleep instead fall into a catatonic slumber for 3d6 x 10 minutes. Unlike with the sleep spell, sleeping creatures cannot be awakened by nonmagical means before this time expires.  Unlike symbol of death, symbol of sleep has no hit point limit; once triggered, a symbol of sleep simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.  Note: Magic traps such as symbol of sleep are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a symbol of sleep and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 30 for symbol of sleep.
