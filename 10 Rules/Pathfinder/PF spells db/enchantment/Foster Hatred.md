Brief:: Cause creatures to hate one type of creature.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

You build upon your targets' innate prejudice, stoking it from a simmer to the full flame of hatred. Choose a creature type (if you choose humanoid or outsider, you must also choose a subtype). Targets who hold no ill will toward and have a completely positive opinion of the chosen creatures automatically succeed at their saving throws, while targets with a particular hatred toward the chosen creature (such as the dwarf's hatred racial ability) take a -4 penalty on their saving throws. Targets that fail their saving throws become hostile toward all creatures of the chosen type and never treat them as allies for the spell's duration. Affected creatures take everything creatures of the chosen type do in the worst possible light.  Since most creatures don't hold ill-will toward their own race, you can use foster hatred toward a smaller subset of creatures of your chosen type, such as worshipers of Shelyn, in order to focus the hatred onto your chosen targets.
