Brief:: As command, but affects one subject/level.

```dataviewjs
customJS.Spell.printWiki(dv)
```

This spell functions like command, except that up to one creature per level may be affected, and the activities continue beyond 1 round. At the start of each commanded creature's action after the first, it gets another Will save to attempt to break free from the spell. Each creature must receive the same command.
