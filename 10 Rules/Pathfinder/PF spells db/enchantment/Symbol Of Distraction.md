This spell functions like symbol of death, except that all creatures within the radius of a symbol of distraction instead become fascinated by the symbol for 10 minutes per caster level. Unlike symbol of death, symbol of distraction has no hit point limit; once triggered, a symbol of distraction simply remains active for a duration of 10 minutes x your caster level. All fascinated creatures move toward the symbol of distraction, trying to remain within the symbol's area of effect. If the symbol leads affected creatures into a dangerous area, each fascinated creature can attempt an additional Will saving throw, with success indicating it is no longer fascinated. If a creature's view of the symbol is completely blocked, it is immediately freed of the symbol's effect.
