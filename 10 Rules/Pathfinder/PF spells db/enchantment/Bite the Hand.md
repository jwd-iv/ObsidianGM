With a short command and a wave of the hand, you compel the target creature to attack the being who summoned it, to the best of its ability. If the being who summoned it is not present, the creature acts normally according to its last task or instructions. This spell has no effect on called creatures, summoned creatures not brought forth by spells or spell-like abilities (such as a summoner's eidolon), or bonded creatures not explicitly summoned, such as a paladin's mount or wizard's familiar.
