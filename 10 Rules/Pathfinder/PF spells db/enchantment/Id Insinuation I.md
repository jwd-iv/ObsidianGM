Brief:: Confuse one creature for the duration of your concentration + 1 round.

By invading the mind of a creature with your psychic presence, you can isolate parts of its mind, preventing the target from functioning in a coherent manner. The target is confused as long as you concentrate on it plus 1 additional round. A successful Will save negates this effect.
