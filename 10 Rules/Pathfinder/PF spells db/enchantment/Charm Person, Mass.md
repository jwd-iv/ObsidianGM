This spell functions like charm person, except that mass charm person affects a number of humanoid creatures whose combined Hit Dice don't exceed twice your level. If there are more potential targets than you can affect, you choose them one at a time until you reach the limit of HD you can affect. If you cast mass charm person on only one creature, you ignore the spell's HD limit.
