# Universal Monster Rules

The following rules are standard and are referenced (but not repeated) in monster stat blocks. Each rule includes a format guide for how it appears in a monster’s listing and its location in the stat block.

### Ability Damage and Drain (Ex or Su)

Some attacks or special abilities cause [ability damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage) or [drain](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Drain), reducing the designated ability score by the listed amount. [Ability damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage) can be healed naturally. [Ability drain](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Drain) is permanent and can only be restored through magic.

*Format*: 1d4 Str [drain](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Drain); *Location*: Special Attacks or individual attacks.

### All-Around Vision (Ex)

The creature sees in all directions at once. It cannot be flanked.

*Format*: all-around vision; *Location*: Defensive Abilities.

### Amazing Initiative \[MA\] (Ex)

The creature has a bonus on [initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative) checks equal to its [Mythic Rank](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic-Rank). As a [free action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions) on its turn, it can expend one use of [Mythic Power](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic-Power) to take an additional [standard action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions) during that turn. This additional [standard action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions) can’t be used to cast a spell. It can’t gain an extra action in this way more than once per round.

*Format*: amazing initiative; *Location*: Special Attacks.

### Amorphous (Ex)

The creature’s body is malleable and shapeless. It is immune to precision damage (like sneak attacks) and critical hits.

*Format*: amorphous; *Location*: Defensive Abilities.

### Amphibious (Ex)

Creatures with this special quality have the [aquatic](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Aquatic) subtype, but they can survive indefinitely on land.

*Format*: amphibious; *Location*: SQ.

### Attach (Ex)

The creature automatically latches onto its target when it successfully makes the listed attack. The creature is considered [grappling](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple), but the target is not. The target can attack or [grapple](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple) the creature as normal, or break the attach with a successful [grapple](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple) or [Escape Artist](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/escape-artist) check. Most creatures with this ability have a [racial bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus) to maintain a [grapple](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple) (listed in its [CMB](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Bonus) entry).

*Format*: attach; *Location*: individual attacks.

### Bleed (Ex)

A creature with this ability causes wounds that continue to bleed, inflicting additional damage each round at the start of the affected creature’s turn. This bleeding can be stopped by a successful DC 15 [Heal](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/heal) skill check or through the application of any magical healing. The amount of damage each round is determined in the creature’s entry.

*Format*: bleed (2d6); *Location*: Special Attacks and individual attacks.

### Blindsense (Ex)

Using nonvisual senses, such as acute smell or hearing, a creature with blindsense notices things it cannot see. The creature usually does not need to make [Perception](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception) checks to pinpoint the location of a creature within range of its blindsense ability, provided that it has line of effect to that creature. Any opponent the creature cannot see still has total [concealment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment) against the creature with blindsense, and the creature still has the normal miss chance when attacking foes that have [concealment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment). Visibility still affects the movement of a creature with blindsense. A creature with blindsense is still denied its [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-) bonus to Armor Class against attacks from creatures it cannot see.

*Format*: blindsense 60 ft.; *Location*: Senses.

### Blindsight (Ex)

This ability is similar to [blindsense](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Blindsight-and-Blindsense), but is far more discerning. Using nonvisual senses, such as sensitivity to vibrations, keen smell, acute hearing, or echolocation, a creature with blindsight maneuvers and fights as well as a sighted creature. Invisibility, darkness, and most kinds of [concealment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment) are irrelevant, though the creature must have line of effect to a creature or object to discern that creature or object. The ability’s range is specified in the creature’s descriptive text. The creature usually does not need to make [Perception](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception) checks to notice creatures within range of its blindsight ability. Unless noted otherwise, blindsight is continuous, and the creature need do nothing to use it. Some forms of blindsight, however, must be triggered as a free action. If so, this is noted in the creature’s description. If a creature must trigger its blindsight ability, the creature gains the benefits of blindsight only during its turn.

*Format*: blindsight 60 ft.; *Location*: Senses.

### Blood Drain (Ex)

The creature drains blood at the end of its turn if it grapples a foe, inflicting [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) damage.

*Format*: blood drain (1d2 [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-)); *Location*: Special Attacks.

### Blood Rage (Ex)

When the creature takes damage in combat, on its next turn it can fly into a rage as a free action. It gains +2 [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) and +2 [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-), but takes a –2 penalty to its AC. The rage lasts as long as the battle or 1 minute, whichever is shorter. It cannot end its rage voluntarily.

*Format*: blood rage; *Location*: Special Attacks.

### Breath Weapon (Su)

Some creatures can exhale a cone, line, or cloud of energy or other magical effects. A breath weapon attack usually deals damage and is often based on some type of energy. Breath weapons allow a [Reflex](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex) save for half damage (DC 10 + 1/2 breathing creature’s racial HD + breathing creature’s [Con](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature’s descriptive text). A creature is immune to its own breath weapon unless otherwise noted. Some breath weapons allow a [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) save or a [Will](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will) save instead of a [Reflex](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex) save. Each breath weapon also includes notes on how often it can be used, even if this number is limited in times per day.

*Format*: breath weapon (60-ft. cone, 8d6 fire damage, [Reflex](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex) DC 20 for half, usable every 1d4 rounds); *Location*: Special Attacks; if the breath is more complicated than damage, it also appears under Special Abilities with its own entry.

### Burn (Ex)

A creature with the burn special attack deals fire damage in addition to damage dealt on a successful hit in melee. Those affected by the burn ability must also succeed on a [Reflex](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex) save or catch fire, taking the listed damage for an additional 1d4 rounds at the start of its turn (DC 10 + 1/2 burning creature’s racial [HD](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-) + burning creature’s [Con](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) modifier). A burning creature can attempt a new save as a full-round action. Dropping and rolling on the ground grants a +4 bonus on this save. Creatures that hit a burning creature with natural weapons or unarmed attacks take fire damage as though hit by the burning creature and must make a [Reflex](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex) save to avoid [catching on fire](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/environmental-rules#TOC-Catching-on-Fire).

*Format*: burn (2d6, DC 15); *Location*: Special Attacks and individual attacks.

### \*Burrow (Ex)

**Note!** Burrow details were not included in this game so the details shown here were copied from [d20srd.org](http://d20srd.org/).

A creature with a [burrow](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow) speed can tunnel through dirt, but not through rock unless the descriptive text says otherwise. Creatures cannot charge or run while [burrow](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow)ing. Most [burrow](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow)ing creatures do not leave behind tunnels other creatures can use (either because the material they tunnel through fills in behind them or because they do not actually dislocate any material when [burrow](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow)ing); see the individual creature descriptions for details.

*Format*: Burrow 30 ft.; *Location*: Speed.



### Capsize (Ex)

A creature with this special quality can attempt to capsize a boat or a ship by ramming it as a charge attack and making a combat maneuver check. The DC of this check is 25, or the result of the captain’s Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher. For each size category the ship is larger than the creature attempting to capsize it, the creature attempting to capsize the ship takes a cumulative –10 penalty on its combat maneuver check.

*Format*: capsize; *Location*: special attacks.

### Change Shape (Su)

A creature with this special quality has the ability to assume the appearance of a specific creature or type of creature (usually a [humanoid](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-humanoid)), but retains most of its own physical qualities. A creature cannot change shape to a form more than one size category smaller or larger than its original form. This ability functions as a [polymorph](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/#Transmutation) spell, the type of which is listed in the creature’s description, but the creature does not adjust its ability scores (although it gains any other abilities of the creature it mimics). Unless otherwise stated, it can remain in an alternate form indefinitely. Some creatures, such as lycanthropes, can transform into unique forms with special modifiers and abilities. These creatures do adjust their ability scores, as noted in their descriptions.

*Format*: change shape (wolf, [beast shape I](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/beast-shape)); *Location*: SQ, and in Special Abilities for creatures with a unique listing.

### Channel Resistance (Ex)

A creature with this special quality (usually an [undead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead)) is less easily affected by clerics or paladins. A creature with channel resistance adds the bonus listed for that creature to saves made to resist the effects of [channel energy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric#channel-energy), including effects that rely on the use of [channel energy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric#channel-energy) (such as the [Command Undead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/command-undead) feat).

*Format*: channel resistance +4; *Location*: Defensive Abilities.

### Climb

A creature with a climb speed has a +8 racial bonus on all [Climb](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/climb) checks. The creature must make a [Climb](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/climb) check to climb any wall or slope with a DC higher than 0, but it can always choose to take 10, even if rushed or threatened while climbing.

If a creature **with** a climb speed chooses an *accelerated climb\**, it moves at double its climb speed (or at its base land speed, whichever is slower) and makes a single [Climb](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/climb) check at a –5 penalty. Such a creature retains its [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-) bonus to Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus to their attacks against it. It cannot, however, use the run action while climbing.

*Format*: Climb 30 ft.; *Location*: Speed.

### Compression (Ex)

The creature can move through an area as small as one-quarter its space without squeezing or one-eighth its space when squeezing.

*Format*: compression; *Location*: Special Qualities.

### Constrict (Ex)\*

When a creature with constrict grapples a foe, when does it deal constrict damage?

A creature with constrict deals this additional damage every time it makes a successful grapple check against a foe. This includes the first check to establish the grapple (such as when using the grab universal monster rule).

\[[Source](http://paizo.com/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1fo#v5748eaic9nid)\]

\*A creature with this special attack can crush an opponent, dealing bludgeoning damage, when it makes a successful [grapple](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple) check (in addition to any other effects caused by a successful check, including additional damage). The amount of damage is given in the creature’s entry and is typically equal to the amount of damage caused by the creature’s melee attack.

*Format*: constrict (1d8+6); *Location*: Special Attacks.

### Construct Traits (Ex)

Constructs are immune to death effects, disease, mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects), necromancy effects, paralysis, poison, sleep, stun, and any effect that requires a [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) save (unless the effect also works on objects, or is harmless). Constructs are not subject to nonlethal damage, [ability damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/#TOC-Ability-Damage-and-Drain-Ex-or-Su-), [ability drain](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/#TOC-Ability-Damage-and-Drain-Ex-or-Su-), [fatigue](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fatigued), [exhaustion](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Exhausted), or [energy drain](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels). Constructs are not at risk of death from massive damage.

*Format*: construct traits; *Location*: Immune.

### Curse (Su)

A creature with this ability bestows a curse upon its enemies. The effects of the curse, including its save, frequency, and cure, are included in the creature’s description. If a curse allows a saving throw, it is usually a [Will](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will) save (DC 10 + 1/2 cursing creature’s racial HD + creature’s [Cha](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-) modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature’s descriptive text). Curses can be removed through [remove curse](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/remove-curse) and similar effects.

*Format*: **Curse Name (Su)** Slam—contact; *save* [Will](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will) DC 14, *frequency* 1 day, *effect* 1d4 Str [drain](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/#TOC-Ability-Damage-and-Drain-Ex-or-Su-); *Location*: Special Attacks and individual attacks.

### Curse of Lycanthropy (Su)

A natural lycanthrope’s bite attack in [animal](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal) or hybrid form infects a [humanoid](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-humanoid) target with lycanthropy ([Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) DC 15 negates). If the victim’s size is not within one size category of the lycanthrope’s size, this ability has no effect.

*Format*: curse of lycanthropy; *Location*: individual attacks.

### Damage Reduction (Ex or Su)

How does DR (damage reduction) interact with magical effects that deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage?

Although the definition of damage reduction says “The creature takes normal damage from energy attacks (even non-magical ones), spells, [spell-like abilities](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-), and [supernatural](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-) abilities,” that’s actually just referring to damage that isn’t specifically called out as being of a particular type, such as fire damage or piercing damage. In other words, DR doesn’t protect against “typeless damage” from magical attacks.

However, if a magical attack specifically mentions that it deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, DR affects that damage normally, as if it were from a physical weapon. (Otherwise the magical attack might as well not have a damage type, as it would only interface with B/P/S damage in a very few corner cases, such as whether or not an [ooze](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze) splits from that attack.)

For example, the [ice storm](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/ice-storm) spell deals 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 2d6 points of cold damage. If you cast [ice storm](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/ice-storm) at a group of [zombies](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/zombie), the [zombie’s](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/zombie) DR 5/slashing protects them against 5 points of the spell’s bludgeoning damage. Their DR doesn’t help them against the spell’s cold damage because DR doesn’t apply to energy attacks.

\[[Source](http://paizo.com/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1fo#v5748eaic9qea)\]

A creature with this special quality ignores damage from most weapons and natural attacks. Wounds heal immediately, or the weapon bounces off harmlessly (in either case, the opponent knows the attack was ineffective). The creature takes normal damage from energy attacks (even nonmagical ones), spells, [spell-like abilities](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-), and [supernatural](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-) abilities. A certain kind of weapon can sometimes damage the creature normally, as noted below.



The entry indicates the amount of damage ignored (usually 5 to 15 points) and the type of weapon that negates the ability.

Some monsters are vulnerable to piercing, bludgeoning, or slashing damage. Others are vulnerable to certain materials, such as [adamantine](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Adamantine), [alchemical silver](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Silver-Alchemical), or cold-forged iron. Attacks from weapons that are not of the correct type or made of the correct material have their damage reduced, although a high [enhancement bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus) can overcome some forms of damage reduction.

Some monsters are vulnerable to magic weapons. Any weapon with at least a +1 magical [enhancement bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus) on attack and damage rolls overcomes the damage reduction of these monsters. Such creatures’ natural weapons (but not their attacks with weapons) are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

A few very powerful monsters are vulnerable only to epic weapons—that is, magic weapons with at least a +6 [enhancement bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus). Such creatures’ natural weapons are also treated as epic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Some monsters are vulnerable to good-, evil-, chaotically, or lawfully aligned weapons. When a cleric casts [align weapon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/align-weapon), affected weapons might gain one or more of these properties, and certain magic weapons have these properties as well. A creature with an [alignment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment) subtype (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) can overcome this type of damage reduction with its natural weapons and weapons it wields as if the weapons or natural weapons had an [alignment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment) (or alignments) that matched the subtype(s) of the creature.

When a damage reduction entry has a dash (—) after the slash, no weapon negates the [damage reduction](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction).

A few creatures are harmed by more than one kind of weapon. A weapon that inflicts damage of either type overcomes this damage reduction.

A few other creatures require combinations of different types of attacks to overcome their damage reduction, and a weapon must be both types to overcome this type of damage reduction. A weapon that is only one type is still subject to damage reduction.

*Format*: DR 5/silver; *Location*: Defensive Abilities.

### Demon Lord Traits ([Ex](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Extraordinary-Abilities-Ex-), [Sp](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-), or [Su](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-))

A [demon lord](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/demon-lords) is a powerful, unique [demon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Demon) that rules a layer of the Abyss. All [demon lords](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/demon-lords) are chaotic evil [outsiders](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider) that are, at a minimum, CR 26. [Demon lords](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/demon-lords) have a particular suite of traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry) as summarized here.

-   A [demon lord](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/demon-lords) can grant spells to its worshipers as if it were a deity. A [demon lord’s](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/demon-lords) domains are Chaos, [Evil](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Evil), and two other domains relevant to its theme and interests. Like a deity, a [demon lord](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/demon-lords) has a favored weapon.
-   A [demon lord’s](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/demon-lords) [natural weapons](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks), as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic, epic, and evil for the purpose of overcoming [damage reduction](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction).
-   *Abyssal Resurrection (Ex)* A [demon lord](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/demon-lords) rules an Abyssal realm, a vast world that not only serves as its home but provides it with power. If a [demon lord](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/demon-lords) is slain, its body rapidly melts into corruption (leaving behind any gear it held or carried), its soul returns to a hidden location within its realm, and it is immediately restored to life (as [true resurrection](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/true-resurrection)) at that location. Once this occurs, a [demon lord](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/demon-lords) can’t use this ability again until a full year has passed. A [demon lord](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/demon-lords) realizes it is vulnerable during this time and usually doesn’t risk further battles for the remainder of that year, relying on the defenses of its realm and its legions of minions to protect it. A [demon lord](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/demon-lords) that is slain again during this year or is killed by unusual methods (such as by a true deity or an artifact created for this purpose) is slain forever—its remains appearing somewhere deep in the Abyss among other [dead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead) [demon lords](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/demon-lords) from the ages. A [demon lord](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/demon-lords) who does not control a domain does not gain this ability.
-   *Frightful Presence (Su)* A [demon lord](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/demon-lords) can activate its [frightful presence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Frightful-Presence-Ex-) as a [free action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions) as part of any attack, [spell-like ability](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-), special attack, or by speaking aloud.

-   *Summon Demons (Sp)* Three times per day as a [swift action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions), a [demon lord](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/demon-lords) can [summon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Summon-Sp-) any [demon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Demon) or combination of [demons](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon) whose total combined CR is 20 or lower. This otherwise works like the [summon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Summon-Sp-) universal monster rule with a 100% chance of success, and counts as a 9th-level spell effect.
-   *Telepathy* 300 feet.

### Disease (Ex or Su)

A creature with this ability causes [disease](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions#TOC-Diseases) in those it contacts. The effects of the [disease](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions#TOC-Diseases), including its save, frequency, and cure, are included in the creature’s description. The [saving throw](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws) to negate the [disease](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions#TOC-Diseases) is usually a [Fort](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) save (DC 10 + 1/2 the infecting creature’s racial [HD](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-) + the creature’s [Con](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature’s descriptive text). [Disease](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions#TOC-Diseases) can be removed through [remove disease](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/remove-disease) and similar effects.

*Format*: **Disease Name (Ex)** Bite—injury; *save* [Fort](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) DC 15, *onset* 1d3 days, *frequency* 1 day, effect 1 [Con](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) [damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/#TOC-Ability-Damage-and-Drain-Ex-or-Su-), *cure* 2 consecutive saves; *Location*: Special Attacks and individual attacks.

### Display of Strength \[MA\] (Su)

As a [free action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions), the creature can expend one use of [Mythic Power](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic-Power) to attempt a feat of Strength, gaining a +20 [circumstance bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus) on one [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-)\-based skill check or [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) ability check. Alternatively, the creature can use this ability to apply a +20 [circumstance bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus) to its [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) score for a number of hours equal to its [Mythic Rank](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic-Rank) for the purpose of determining its carrying capacity.

*Format*: display of strength; *Location*: SQ.

### Distraction (Ex)

A creature with this ability can [nauseate](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated) the creatures that it damages. Any living creature that takes damage from a creature with the distraction ability is [nauseated](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated) for 1 round; a [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) save (DC 10 + 1/2 creature’s HD + creature’s [Con](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) modifier) negates the effect.

*Format*: distraction (DC 14); *Location*: Special Attacks.

### Dragon Senses (Ex)

Dragons have [darkvision](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Darkvision) 120 ft. and [blindsense](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Blindsight-and-Blindsense) 60 ft. They see four times as well as a [human](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human) in dim light and twice as well in normal light.

*Format*: dragon senses; *Location*: Senses.

### Dual Initiative \[MA\] (Ex)

The creature gets two turns each round, one on its [initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative) count and another on its [initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative) count – 20. For example, if the monster’s [initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative) is 23, for its first turn it could make a full attack (and take a 5 foot step) at [initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative) 23, and for its second turn at [initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative) 3 it could take a [move action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions) and cast a spell. This allows the monster to perform two actions per round that normally take an entire round, such as using a [summon monster](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/summon-monster) spell. For the purposes of spells and effects that have a duration of a round or longer or trigger at the beginning of the creature’s round or the start of its turn (such as saving throws against ongoing effects or taking bleed damage), only the creature’s first turn each round counts toward such durations.

*Format*: +21/+1; *Location*: Initiative.



### Earth Glide (Ex)

When the creature [burrow](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow)s, it can pass through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water. If protected against fire damage, it can even glide through lava. Its [burrow](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow)ing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of its presence. A [move earth](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/move-earth) spell cast on an area containing the [burrow](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow)ing creature flings it back 30 feet, stunning it for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) save.

*Format*: earth glide; *Location*: Speed.

### Emotion Aura (Su)

**Source** [PRG:OB](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1601257678/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1601257678&linkCode=as2&tag=httpwwwd20pfs-20&linkId=NZXU3XBU465PLWZ3)

A creature with this ability surrounds itself with an area of swirling, chaotic emotions.

These emotions make it difficult for spellcasters to cast spells with the emotion component. Living creatures within 30 feet must succeed at a [concentration](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration) check (DC = 10 + 1/2 the HD of the creature with an emotion aura + that creature’s [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-) modifier) to cast a spell with an emotion component. Failing this check causes the spell to be lost with no effect. In addition, any spellcaster casting spells with the emotion or [fear descriptor](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Fear) on targets inside this aura must succeed at this check or the spell fails to affect targets within the aura (although others outside the area are affected as normal).

Creatures with this ability are immune to its effects and can cast spells normally.

*Format*: emotion (DC 17); *Location*: Aura.

### Empyreal Lord Traits ([Ex](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Extraordinary-Abilities-Ex-), [Sp](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-), or [Su](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-))

Empyreal lords are the greatest members of the [agathion](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Agathion), [angel](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Angel), [archon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Archon), and [azata](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Azata) races, and are sometimes worshiped as if they were deities. All empyreal lords are good [outsiders](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider) that are, at a minimum, CR 21. In addition to having [agathion](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Agathion), [angel](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Angel), [archon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Archon), or [azata](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Azata) traits, Empyreal lords have a particular suite of traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry) as summarized here.

-   An empyreal lord’s [natural weapons](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks), as well as any weapons he or she wields, are treated as epic and good for the purpose of overcoming [damage reduction](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction). If the empyreal lord is chaotic or lawful, these attacks also count as that [alignment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment) for the purpose of overcoming [damage reduction](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction).
-   [Agathion](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/agathion), [angel](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Angel), [archon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Archon), or [azata](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Azata) energy resistances are increased to 30.
-   An empyreal lord can grant spells to its worshipers as if it were a deity. An empyreal lord’s domains are Chaos (if chaotic), Good, Law (if lawful), and two other domains relevant to its theme and interests (or three if it is neither chaotic nor lawful). Like a deity, an empyreal lord has a favored weapon.
-   *Blindsense* 60 feet.
-   *Greater Teleport (Sp)* An empyreal lord can use [greater teleport](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/teleport) at will ([caster level](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level) 20th).
-   Immunity to [ability damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage), [ability drain](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Drain), [charm](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Enchantment-Charm) effects, [compulsion](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Enchantment-Compulsion) effects, death effects, energy drain, and petrification.
-   *Primal Aura (Su)* An aura of primeval power surrounds every empyreal lord. The effects of this aura are unique to each empyreal lord.
-   *Regeneration (Ex)* Only epic and evil damage, or damage from a creature of equal or greater power (such as an archdevil, deity, [demon lord](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/demon/demon-lords), or [protean](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Protean) lord) interrupts an empyreal lord’s [regeneration](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Regeneration-Ex-).
-   *Seed of Life (Sp)* An empyreal lord can touch a willing creature and imbue it with magical healing power. The target radiates an aura of good as if it were an [outsider](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider) and gains a +2 [insight bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Insight-Bonus) on all saving throws against negative energy and death effects. As a [standard action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions), the target can release this energy, turning it inward as a [heal](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/heal) spell upon itself or outward as a [mass cure serious wounds](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/cure-serious-wounds) spell on allies within 30 feet ([caster level](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level) 15th). If not released, the energy dissipates harmlessly after 24 hours. The empyreal lord can use this ability 5 times per day, but only on other creatures.
-   *Energy Drain (Su)* This attack saps a living opponent’s vital energy and happens automatically when a melee or ranged attack hits. Each successful energy drain bestows one or more [negative levels](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels) (the creature’s description specifies how many). If an attack that includes an energy drain scores a [critical hit](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits), it bestows twice the listed number of [negative levels](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels). Unless otherwise specified in the creature’s description, a draining creature gains 5 [temporary hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points) for each [negative level](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels) it bestows on an opponent. These [temporary hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points) last for a maximum of 1 hour. Negative levels remain until 24 hours have passed or until they are removed with a spell, such as [restoration](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/restoration). If a [negative level](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels) is not removed before 24 hours have passed, the affected creature must attempt a [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) save (DC 10 + 1/2 draining creature’s racial HD + draining creature’s [Cha](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-) modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature’s descriptive text). On a success, the [negative level](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels) goes away with no harm to the creature. On a failure, the [negative level](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels) becomes permanent. A separate saving throw is required for each [negative level](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels).

*Format*: energy drain (2 levels, DC 18); *Location*: Special Attacks and individual attacks.

### Energy Drain (Su)\*

Does a creature struck by an attack with energy drain get an initial saving throw at the time of the attack or only 24 hours later to try and remove it?

Unless the monster or effect description **SPECIFICALLY SAYS** you get an initial saving throw… you don’t get an initial saving throw.

Effects that grant initial saving throws against an energy drain effect are pretty rare. I actually can’t think of any that are in the rules right now, in fact.

\[[Source](http://paizo.com/forums/dmtz1zxs?Pathfinder-Energy-Drain#5)\]

This attack saps a living opponent’s vital energy and happens automatically when a melee or ranged attack hits. Each successful energy drain bestows one or more negative levels (the creature’s description specifies how many). If an attack that includes an energy drain scores a [critical hit](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits), it bestows twice the listed number of negative levels. Unless otherwise specified in the creature’s description, a draining creature gains 5 [temporary hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points) for each [negative level](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels) it bestows on an opponent. These [temporary hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points) last for a maximum of 1 hour. Negative levels remain until 24 hours have passed or until they are removed with a spell such as [restoration](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/restoration). If a [negative level](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels) is not removed before 24 hours have passed, the affected creature must attempt a [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) save (DC 10 + 1/2 the draining creature’s racial [HD](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-) + the draining creature’s [Cha](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-) modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature’s descriptive text). On a success, the [negative level](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels) goes away with no harm to the creature. On a failure, the [negative level](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels) becomes permanent. A separate [saving throw](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws) is required for each [negative level](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels).

*Format*: energy drain (2 levels, DC 18); *Location*: Special Attacks and individual attacks.

### Engulf (Ex)

The creature can engulf creatures in its path as part of a standard action. It cannot make other attacks during a round in which it engulfs. The creature merely has to move over its opponents, affecting as many as it can cover. Targeted creatures can make [attacks of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) against the creature, but if they do so, they are not entitled to a [saving throw](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws) against the engulf attack. Those who do not attempt [attacks of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) can attempt a [Reflex](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex) save to avoid being engulfed—on a success, they are pushed back or aside (target’s choice) as the creature moves forward. Engulfed opponents gain the [pinned](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Pinned) condition, are in danger of suffocating, are trapped within the creature’s body until they are no longer [pinned](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Pinned), and may be subject to other special attacks from the creature. The save DC is [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-)\-based.

*Format*: engulf (DC 12, 1d6 acid and [paralysis](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Paralysis)); *Location*: Special Attacks.

### Entrap (Ex or Su)

The creature has an ability that restricts another creature’s movement, usually with a physical attack such as ice, mud, lava, or webs. The target of an entrap attack must make a [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) save or become [entangled](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Entangled) for the listed duration. If a target is already [entangled](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Entangled) by this ability, a second entrap attack means the target must make a [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) save or become [helpless](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless) for the listed duration. The save DCs are [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-)\-based. A target made [helpless](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless) by this ability is conscious but can take no physical actions (except attempting to break free) until the entrapping material is removed. The target can use spells with only verbal [components](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components) or [spell-like abilities](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-) if it can make a DC 20 [concentration](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration) check. An [entangled](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Entangled) creature can make a [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) check (at the same DC as the entrap [saving throw](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws) DC) as a full-round action to break free; the DC for a [helpless](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless) creature is +5 Greater than the [saving throw](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws) DC. Destroying the entrapping material frees the creature.

*Format*: entrap (DC 13, 1d10 minutes, hardness 5, hp 10); *Location*: special attacks and individual attacks.

### Fast Healing (Ex)

A creature with the fast healing special quality regains [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) at an exceptional rate, usually 1 or more [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) per round, as given in the creature’s entry. Except where noted here, fast healing is just like natural healing. Fast healing does not restore [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation, nor does it allow a creature to regrow lost body parts. Unless otherwise stated, it does not allow lost body parts to be reattached. Fast healing continues to function (even at negative [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points)) until a creature dies, at which point the effects of fast healing end immediately.

*Format*: fast healing 5; *Location*: hp.

### Fast Swallow (Ex)

The creature can use its [swallow whole](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/#TOC-Swallow-Whole-Ex-) ability as a free action at any time during its turn, not just at the start of its turn.

*Format*: fast swallow; *Location*: Special Attacks.

### Fear (Su or Sp)

Fear attacks can have various effects.

**Fear Aura (Su)** The use of this ability is a free action. The aura can freeze an opponent (as in the case of a mummy’s despair) or function like the [fear](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/fear) spell. Other effects are possible. A fear aura is an area effect. The descriptive text gives the size and kind of the area.



**Fear Cone (Sp) and Ray (Su)** These effects usually work like the [fear](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/fear) spell.

If a fear effect allows a [saving throw](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws), it is a [Will](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will) save (DC 10 + 1/2 fearsome creature’s racial [HD](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-) + creature’s [Cha](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-) modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature’s descriptive text). All fear attacks are mind-affecting fear effects.

*Format*: fear aura (30 ft., DC 17); *Location*: Aura.

*Format*: fear cone (50 ft., DC 19); *Location*: Special Attacks.

### Ferocity (Ex)

A creature with ferocity remains conscious and can continue fighting even if its hit point total is below 0. The creature is still [staggered](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered) and loses 1 hit point each round. A creature with ferocity still dies when its hit point total reaches a negative amount equal to its [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) score.

*Format*: ferocity; *Location*: Defensive Abilities.

### Flight (Ex or Su)

When a character or creature is flying, and that creature decides to ascend at a 45 degree angle, the rules states that it moves at half speed? Do the rules for diagonal square counting still apply when moving up diagonally in this way?

No. Since the game is generally assumed to be played in two dimensions, even when representing three dimensional combat, the rules for ascending are handled by the speed reduction instead of asking players and GMs to ascertain the diagonal vertical movement.

\[[Source](http://paizo.com/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1fm#v5748eaic9o76)\]

A creature with this ability can cease or resume flight as a free action. If the ability is supernatural, it becomes ineffective in an [antimagic field](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/antimagic-field), and the creature loses its ability to fly for as long as the antimagic effect persists.

**Note**: Creatures with a fly speed treat the Fly skill as a class skill. A creature with a natural fly speed receives a bonus (or penalty) on Fly skill checks depending on its maneuverability:

-   Clumsy –8
-   Poor –4
-   Average +0
-   Good +4
-   Perfect +8

Creatures without a maneuverability rating are assumed to have average maneuverability and take no penalty on Fly checks.

*Format*: fly 30 ft. (average); *Location*: Speed.

### Formian Traits (Ex or Su)

Formians are a spacefaring race of insectlike creatures from a forest world that aggressively colonize other worlds. A formian possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).

-   *Darkvision* 60 feet and blindsense 30 feet.
-   *Hive Mind (Ex)* Formians share a telepathic bond with other members of their hive that enhances their hive mates’ perception. As long as a formian is within telepathic range of at least one hive mate, it gains a +4 racial bonus on initiative checks and Perception checks. If at least one formian disbelieves an illusion, all formians within its telepathic range are also considered to disbelieve that illusion. If one formian is aware of combatants, all other hive mates within the range of its telepathy are also aware of those combatants.
-   *Resistance* to sonic 10.
-   *Telepathic Caster (Ex)* Due to a formian’s telepathic nature, if it casts spells it does so as spell-like abilities.
-   *Telepathy* 60 ft.

### Fortification (Ex)

The monster has an 50% chance to treat any [critical hit](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits) or [sneak attack](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Sneak-Attack) as a normal hit, as if wearing moderate fortif ication armor.

*Format*: fortification (50%); *Location*: Defensive Abilities.

### Freeze (Ex)

The creature can hold itself so still it appears to be an inanimate object of the appropriate shape (a statue, patch of fungus, and so on). The creature can take 20 on its [Stealth](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/stealth) check to hide in plain sight as this kind of inanimate object.

*Format*: freeze; *Location*: Special Qualities.

### Frightful Presence (Ex)

This special quality makes a creature’s very presence unsettling to foes. Activating this ability is a free action that is usually part of an attack or [charge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Charge). Opponents within range who witness the action may become [frightened](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Frightened) or [shaken](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Shaken). The range is usually 30 feet, and the duration is usually 5d6 rounds. This ability affects only opponents with fewer [Hit Dice](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-) than the creature has. An opponent can resist the effects with a successful [Will](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will) save (DC 10 + 1/2 the frightful creature’s racial [HD](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-) + the frightful creature’s [Cha](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-) modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature’s descriptive text). An opponent that succeeds on the [saving throw](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws) is immune to that same creature’s [frightful presence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Frightful-Presence-Ex-) for 24 hours. On a failed save, the opponent is [shaken](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Shaken), or [panicked](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Panicked) if it has 4 [Hit Dice](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-) or fewer. Frightful presence is a mind-affecting [fear](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/fear) effect.

*Format*: frightful presence (60 ft., DC 21); *Location*: Aura.

### Gaze (Su)

A gaze special attack takes effect when foes look at the attacking creature’s eyes. The attack can have any sort of effect; petrification, death, and charm are common. The typical range is 30 feet, but check the creature’s entry for details. The type of [saving throw](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws) for a gaze attack varies, but it is usually a [Will](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will) or [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) save (DC 10 + 1/2 gazing creature’s racial [HD](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-) + gazing creature’s [Cha](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-) modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature’s text). A successful [saving throw](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws) negates the effect. A monster’s gaze attack is described in abbreviated form in its description. Each opponent within range of a gaze attack must attempt a [saving throw](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws) each round at the beginning of his or her turn in the [initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative) order. Only looking directly at a creature with a gaze attack leaves an opponent vulnerable. Opponents can avoid the need to make the [saving throw](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws) by not looking at the creature, in one of two ways.

**Averting Eyes**: The opponent avoids looking at the creature’s face, instead looking at its body, watching its shadow, tracking it in a reflective surface, etc. Each round, the opponent has a 50% chance to avoid having to make a [saving throw](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws) against the gaze attack. The creature with the gaze attack, however, gains [concealment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment) against that opponent.

**Wearing a Blindfold**: The foe cannot see the creature at all (also possible to achieve by turning one’s back on the creature or shutting one’s eyes). The creature with the gaze attack gains total [concealment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment) against the opponent.

A creature with a gaze attack can actively gaze as an attack action by choosing a target within range. That opponent must attempt a [saving throw](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws) but can try to avoid this as described above. Thus, it is possible for an opponent to save against a creature’s gaze twice during the same round, once before the opponent’s action and once during the creature’s turn.

Gaze attacks can affect ethereal opponents. A creature is immune to gaze attacks of others of its kind unless otherwise noted. Allies of a creature with a gaze attack might be affected. All the creature’s allies are considered to be averting their eyes from the creature with the gaze attack, and have a 50% chance to not need to make a [saving throw](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws) against the gaze attack each round. The creature can also veil its eyes, thus negating its gaze ability.

*Format*: gaze; *Location*: Special Attacks.

### Grab (Ex)



The grab rules say the ability only works on creatures smaller than the monster, but the grab rules in Bestiary 2 say the ability works on creatures of up to the monster’s own size. Which is correct?

Bestiary 2 is the newer, updated version: grab works on creatures up to the size of the monster with the grab ability.

\[[Source](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8auu/faq#35v5748eaic9nsz)\]

If a creature with this special attack hits with the indicated attack (usually a claw or bite attack), it deals normal damage and attempts to start a [grapple](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple) as a [free action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions) without provoking an [attack of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity). Unless otherwise noted, grab can only be used against targets of a size equal to or smaller than the creature with this ability. If the creature can use grab on creatures of other sizes, it is noted in the creature’s Special Attacks line. The creature has the option to conduct the [grapple](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple) normally, or simply use the part of its body it used in the grab to hold the opponent. If it chooses to do the latter, it takes a –20 penalty on its [CMB](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Bonus) check to make and maintain the [grapple](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple), but does not gain the [grappled](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled) condition itself. A successful hold does not deal any extra damage unless the creature also has the [constrict](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Constrict-Ex-) special attack. If the creature does not [constrict](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Constrict-Ex-), each successful [grapple](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple) check it makes during successive rounds automatically deals the damage indicated for the attack that established the hold. Otherwise, it deals constriction damage as well (the amount is given in the creature’s descriptive text).

Creatures with the grab special attack receive a +4 bonus on [combat maneuver](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers) checks made to start and maintain a [grapple](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple).

*Format*: grab; *Location*: individual attacks and special attacks.

### Greensight (Su)

The monster can see through thick plant matter as though it were transparent, usually with a range of 60 feet. Leaves, vines, greenery, and undergrowth offer no [concealment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment) to the monster’s sight, though solid wood still blocks its line of sight.

*Format*: greensight 60 ft.; *Location*: Senses.

### Heat (Ex)

The creature generates so much heat that its mere touch deals additional fire damage. The creature’s metallic melee weapons also conduct this heat.

*Format*: heat (1d6 fire); *Location*: Special Attacks.

### Hold Breath (Ex)

The creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 6 times its [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) score before it risks drowning.

*Format*: hold breath; *Location*: Special Qualities

### Immunity (Ex or Su)

A creature with immunities takes no damage from listed sources. Immunities can also apply to afflictions, conditions, spells (based on school, level, or save type), and other effects. A creature that is immune does not suffer from these effects, or any secondary effects that are triggered due to an immune effect.

*Format*: **Immune** acid, fire, paralysis; *Location*: Defensive Abilities.

### Incorporeal (Ex)

An incorporeal creature has no physical body. It can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons or creatures that strike as magic weapons, and spells, [spell-like abilities](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-), or [supernatural](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-) abilities. It is immune to all nonmagical attack forms. Even when hit by spells or magic weapons, it takes only half damage from a corporeal source (except for [channel energy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric#channel-energy)). Although it is not a magical attack, holy water can affect incorporeal [undead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead). Corporeal spells and effects that do not cause damage only have a 50% chance of affecting an incorporeal creature. Force spells and effects, such as from a [magic missile](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/magic-missile), affect an incorporeal creature normally.

An incorporeal creature has no [natural armor bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Natural-Armor-Bonus) but has a [deflection](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Deflection-Bonus) bonus equal to its [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-) bonus (always at least +1, even if the creature’s [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-) score does not normally provide a bonus).

An incorporeal creature can enter or pass through solid objects, but must remain adjacent to the object’s exterior, and so cannot pass entirely through an object whose space is larger than its own. It can sense the presence of creatures or objects within a square adjacent to its current location, but enemies have total [concealment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment) (50% miss chance) from an incorporeal creature that is inside an object. In order to see beyond the object it is in and attack normally, the incorporeal creature must emerge. An incorporeal creature inside an object has total [cover](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Cover), but when it attacks a creature outside the object it only has [cover](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Cover), so a creature outside with a [readied](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Ready) action could strike at it as it attacks. An incorporeal creature cannot pass through a force effect.

An incorporeal creature’s attacks pass through (ignore) [natural armor](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Natural-Armor-Bonus), [armor](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus), and shields, although [deflection](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Deflection-Bonus) bonuses and force effects (such as [mage armor](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/mage-armor)) work normally against it. [Incorporeal](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Incorporeal-Ex-) creatures pass through and operate in water as easily as they do in air. [Incorporeal](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Incorporeal-Ex-) creatures cannot fall or take falling damage. [Incorporeal](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Incorporeal-Ex-) creatures cannot make [trip](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Trip) or [grapple](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple) attacks, nor can they be [tripped](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Trip) or [grappled](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled). In fact, they cannot take any physical action that would move or manipulate an opponent or its equipment, nor are they subject to such actions. [Incorporeal](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Incorporeal-Ex-) creatures have no weight and do not set off traps that are triggered by weight.

An incorporeal creature moves silently and cannot be heard with [Perception](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception) checks if it doesn’t wish to be. It has no [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) score, so its [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-) modifier applies to its melee attacks, ranged attacks, and [CMB](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Bonus). Nonvisual senses, such as [scent](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Scent) and [blindsight](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Blindsight-and-Blindsense), are either ineffective or only partly effective with regard to incorporeal creatures. [Incorporeal](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Incorporeal-Ex-) creatures have an innate sense of direction and can move at full speed even when they cannot see.

*Format*: incorporeal; *Location*: Defensive Abilities.

### Jet (Ex)

The creature can swim backward as a full-round action at the listed speed. It must move in a straight line while jetting, and does not provoke [attacks of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) when it does so.

*Format*: jet (200 ft.); *Location*: Speed.

### Keen Scent (Ex)

The creature can notice other creatures by [scent](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Scent) in a 180-foot radius underwater and can detect blood in the water at ranges of up to a mile.

*Format*: keen scent; *Location*: Senses.

### Lifesense (Su)

The creature notices and locates living creatures within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the [blindsight](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Blindsight-and-Blindsense) ability.

*Format*: lifesense; *Location*: Senses.

### Light Blindness (Ex)

Creatures with light blindness are blinded for 1 round if exposed to bright light, such as sunlight or the [daylight](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/daylight) spell. Such creatures are [dazzled](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dazzled) as long as they remain in areas of bright light.

*Format*: light blindness; *Location*: Weaknesses.



### Light Sensitivity (Ex)

Creatures with light sensitivity are [dazzled](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dazzled) in areas of bright sunlight or within the radius of a [daylight](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/daylight) spell.

*Format*: **Weakness** light sensitivity; *Location*: Weaknesses.

### Low-Light Vision (Ex)

A creature with [low-light vision](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Low-Light-Vision) can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of dim light. It retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.

*Format*: low-light vision; *Location*: Senses.

### Lycanthropic Empathy (Ex)

In any form, natural lycanthropes can communicate and empathize with [animals](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal) related to their animal form. They can use [Diplomacy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/diplomacy) to alter such an animal’s attitude, and when so doing gain a +4 [racial bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus) on the check. Afflicted lycanthropes only gain this ability in [animal](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal) or hybrid form.

*Format*: lycanthropic empathy (bears and dire bears); *Location*: Special Qualities.

### Mental Static Aura (Su)

**Source** [PRG:OB](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1601257678/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1601257678&linkCode=as2&tag=httpwwwd20pfs-20&linkId=NZXU3XBU465PLWZ3)

A creature with this ability creates a field around it that makes concentrating difficult for those without this ability. Living creatures within 30 feet must succeed at a [concentration](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration) check (DC = 10 + 1/2 the HD of the creature with a mental static aura + that creature’s [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-) modifier) to cast a spell with a thought component. Failing this check causes the spell to be lost with no effect. In addition, all spellcasters must attempt this check at the start of their turns if they are concentrating on an active spell or effect.

Failing it means that they cease concentrating on the spell or effect. Creatures with this ability are immune to its effects and can cast spells normally.

*Format*: mental static (DC 18); *Location*: Aura.

### Mistsight (Ex)

The monster can see through fog, mist, and murky water as if they were perfectly clear, ignoring the miss chance for these obstructions, up to its normal range of [vision](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/v/vision).

*Format*: mistsight; *Location*: Senses.

### Mythic Immortality \[MA\] (Su)

If the creature is killed, it returns to life 24 hours later, regardless of the condition of its body or the means by which it was killed. When it returns to life, it isn’t treated as if it had rested, and doesn’t regain the use of abilities that recharge with rest until it next rests. This ability doesn’t apply if it is killed by a [coup de grace](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#coup-de-grace) or [critical hit](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits) performed by either a [Mythic](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic) creature (or creature of even greater power) or a [Non-Mythic](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Non-Mythic) creature wielding a weapon capable of bypassing epic [damage reduction](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction). If the creature is [Mythic Rank](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic-Rank) 10, it can be killed only by a [coup de grace](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#coup-de-grace) or [critical hit](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits) made with an artifact. (This ability is called “immortal” in Mythic Adventures.)

*Format*: Mythic immortality; *Location*: SQ.

### Mythic Magic \[MA\] (Su)

Up to three times per day, when the creature casts a spell, it can cast the Mythic version instead (as with all [Mythic Spells](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic/mythic-magic/mythic-spells), the creature must expend [Mythic Power](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic-Power) to cast a Mythic spell in this way).

*Format*: [Mythic Magic](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic/mythic-magic) 3/day; *Location*: Special Attacks.

### Mythic Power \[MA\] (Su)

The Mythic monster can draw upon a wellspring of power to accomplish amazing deeds and cheat fate. Each day, it can expend a number of uses of [Mythic Power](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic-Power) equal to its [Mythic Rank](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic-Rank). This amount is its maximum amount of [Mythic Power](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic-Power). If an ability allows it to regain [Mythic Power](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic-Power), it can never gain more than this amount. The monster automatically has the Surge ability, and can use this [Mythic Power](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic-Power) to activate it. It may have other abilities that rely on [Mythic Power](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic-Power).

*Format*: [Mythic Power](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic-Power) (3/day, [Surge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Surge) +1d6); *Location*: Special Attacks.

### Multiweapon Mastery (Ex)

The creature never takes penalties on its attack rolls when fighting with multiple weapons.

*Format*: multiweapon mastery; *Location*: Special Attacks.

### Natural Attacks

Most creatures possess one or more natural attacks (attacks made without a weapon). These attacks fall into one of two categories, primary and secondary attacks. Primary attacks are made using the creature’s full [base attack bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus) and add the creature’s full [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) bonus on damage rolls. Secondary attacks are made using the creature’s [base attack bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus) –5 and add only 1/2 the creature’s [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) bonus on damage rolls. If a creature has only one [natural attack](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks), it is always made using the creature’s full [base attack bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus) and adds 1-1/2 times the creature’s [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) bonus on damage rolls. This increase does not apply if the creature has multiple attacks but only takes one. If a creature has only one type of attack, but has multiple attacks per round, that attack is treated as a primary attack, regardless of its type. You do not receive additional natural attacks for a high base attack bonus. Instead, you receive additional attack rolls for multiple limb and body parts capable of making the attack (as noted by the race or ability that grants the attacks).

**Table: Natural Attacks by Size** lists some of the most common types of natural attacks and their classifications.

### Table: Natural Attacks by Size

| Natural Attack | Base Damage by Size\* | Damage Type | Attack type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fine | Dim. | Tiny | Small | Medium | Large | Huge | Garg. | Col. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

I’m confused by how to increase and decrease manufactured and natural weapon damage dice when the weapon’s size or effective size changes. There’s a bunch of different charts, and I’m not sure which to use.

When the damage dealt by a creature’s weapons or natural attacks changes due to a change in its size (or the size of its weapon), use the following rules to determine the new damage.

-   If the size increases by one step, look up the original damage on the chart and increase the damage by two steps. If the initial size is Small or lower (or is treated as Small or lower) or the initial damage is 1d6 or less, instead increase the damage by one step.
-   If the size decreases by one step, look up the original damage on the chart and decrease the damage by two steps. If the initial size is Medium or lower (or is treated as Medium or lower) or the initial damage is 1d8 or less, instead decrease the damage by one step.
-   If the exact number of original dice is not found on this chart, apply the following before adjusting the damage dice. If the damage is a number of d6, find the next lowest number of d6 on the chart and use that number of d8 as the original damage value (for example, 10d6 would instead be treated as 8d8). If the damage is a number of d8, find the next highest number of d8 on the chart and use that number of d6 as the original damage value (for example, 5d8 would instead be treated as 6d6). Once you have the new damage value, adjust by the number of steps noted above.
-   If the die type is not referenced on this chart, apply the following rules before adjusting the damage dice. 2d4 counts as 1d8 on the chart, 3d4 counts as 2d6 on the chart, and so on for higher numbers of d4. 1d12 counts as 2d6 on the chart, and so on for higher numbers of d12.
-   Finally, 2d10 increases to 4d8 and decreases to 2d8, regardless of the initial size, and so on for higher numbers of d10.

\* Individual creatures vary from this value as appropriate.

Some creatures treat one or more of their attacks differently, such as [Dragons](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Dragon), which always receive 1-1/2 times their [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) bonus on damage rolls with their bite attack. These exceptions are noted in the creature’s description.

Creatures with natural attacks and attacks made with weapons can use both as part of a full attack action (although often a creature must forgo one [natural attack](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks) for each weapon clutched in that limb, be it a claw, tentacle, or slam). Such creatures attack with their weapons normally but treat all of their available natural attacks as secondary attacks during that attack, regardless of the attack’s original type.

Some creatures do not have natural attacks. These creatures can make unarmed strikes just like humans do. See **Table: Natural Attacks by Size** for typical damage values for natural attacks by creature size.

*Format*: bite +5 (1d6+1), 2 claws +5 (1d4+2), 4 tentacles +0 (1d4+1); *Location*: Melee and Ranged.

### Natural Invisibility (Ex or Su)

This ability is constant—the creature remains invisible at all times, even when attacking. As this ability is inherent, it is not subject to the [invisibility purge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/invisibility-purge) spell.

*Format*: natural invisibility; *Location*: Defensive Abilities.

### Negative Energy Affinity (Ex)\*

How is Negative Energy Affinity supposed to work?

The intent of this ability is that the creature is healed by negative energy (like an [undead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead)) and harmed by positive energy (like an [undead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead)); this is automatic and has nothing to do with the intent of the target or the energy-wielder. However, as written, the ability is a bit confusing because of the phrase “reacts to,” which doesn’t have a clear definition.

**Update**: In the description of the [Negative Energy Affinity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Negative-Energy-Affinity-Ex-) ability, replace the current entry with the following:

### Negative Energy Affinity (Ex)

The creature is alive, but is treated as [undead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead) for all effects that affect [undead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead) differently than living creatures, such as cure spells and channeled energy. Format: [negative energy affinity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Negative-Energy-Affinity-Ex-); *Location*: Defensive Abilities.

\[[Source](http://paizo.com/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1fo#v5748eaic9oyk)\]

\*The creature is alive but is healed by negative energy and harmed by positive energy, as if it were an undead creature.

*Format*: negative energy affinity; *Location*: Defensive Abilities.

### No Breath (Ex)

The monster does not breathe, and is immune to effects that require breathing (such as inhaled [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions#TOC-Poison)). This does not give [immunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-) to cloud or gas attacks that do not require breathing.

*Format*: no breath; *Location*: Special Qualities.

### Paralysis (Ex or Su)

This special attack renders the victim immobile. Paralyzed creatures cannot move, speak, or take any physical actions. The creature is rooted to the spot, frozen and [helpless](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless). [Paralysis](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Paralysis-Ex-or-Su-) works on the body, and a character can usually resist it with a [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) [saving throw](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws) (DC 10 + 1/2 the paralyzing creature’s racial [HD](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-) + the paralyzing creature’s [Con](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) modifier; the DC is given in the creature’s description). Unlike [hold person](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/hold-person) and similar effects, a [paralysis](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Paralysis) effect does not allow a new save each round. A winged creature flying in the air at the time that it is [paralyzed](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Paralyzed) cannot flap its wings and falls. A swimmer can’t swim and may drown. The duration of the [paralysis](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Paralysis) varies and is included in the creature’s description.

*Format*: paralysis (1d4 rounds, DC 18); *Location*: Special Attacks and individual attacks.

### Plantbringer \[MA\] (Su)

All plants within a 1-mile radius of the creature grow at double their normal rate and don’t suffer from any diseases or maladies. Allied [plant](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Plant) creatures within 30 feet of the creature gain [fast healing](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/alchemist/discoveries/paizo-alchemist-grand-discoveri/fast-healing) equal to the creature’s [Mythic Rank](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic-Rank). If the creature uses [plant shape](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/plant-shape-i) or [wild shape](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid#TOC-Wild-Shape-Su-) to take the form of a plant, it gains this [fast healing](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/alchemist/discoveries/paizo-alchemist-grand-discoveri/fast-healing) in [plant](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Plant) form.

*Format*: plantbringer; *Location*: SQ

### Plant Traits (Ex)

Plants are immune to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, morale effects, patterns, and phantasms), paralysis, poison, polymorph, sleep, and stun.

*Format*: plant traits; *Location*: Immune.

### Poison (Ex or Su)

A creature with this ability can [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions#TOC-Poison) those it attacks. The effects of the [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions#TOC-Poison), including its save, frequency, and cure, are included in the creature’s description. The [saving throw](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws) to resist a [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions#TOC-Poison) is usually a [Fort](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) save (DC 10 + 1/2 the poisoning creature’s racial [HD](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-) + the creature’s [Con](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature’s descriptive text). Poisons can be removed through [neutralize poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/n/neutralize-poison) and similar effects.

*Format*: **Poison Name (Ex)** Sting—injury; *save* Fort DC 22, *frequency* 1/round for 6 rounds, *effect* 1d4 [Con](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-), *cure* 2 consecutive saves; *Location*: Special Attacks and individual attacks.

### Poisonous Blood (Ex)

Any creature that confirms a [critical hit](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits) against the monster with a piercing or slashing melee weapon is sprayed with [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison). (Melee weapons with reach don’t endanger their users in this way.) The type of [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison) depends on the monster. Unless otherwise stated, this [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison) uses the [poison’s](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison) normal DC, though some monsters might have a [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison) DC that’s [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-)\-based.

*Format*: poisonous blood ([dragon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Dragon) bile); *Location*: Defensive Abilities.

### Pounce (Ex)

Can a creature with pounce make iterative attacks with weapons as part of my full attack?

Any melee attack sequence you can perform as a full attack is allowed as part of the [charge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Charge)\-pounce-full attack. For example, a [barbarian](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian) with the greater [beast totem](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian/rage-powers/paizo-rage-powers/beast-totem-su) [rage power](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian#TOC-Rage-Powers-Ex-) gains the pounce universal monster ability and could make iterative attacks with manufactured melee weapons as part of her [charge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Charge)\-pounce-full attack.

\[[Source](http://paizo.com/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1fo#v5748eaic9p05)\]

If a creature with pounce is under a [slow](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/slow) effect, and it charges, does it still get its full attack from [pounce](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Pounce-Ex-)?

According to the rules as written, pounce would allow the creature its full attack, despite the slow effect. (This happens because there is no “partial [charge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Charge)” action.)

\[[Source](http://paizo.com/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1fo#v5748eaic9quy)\]

If a creature with pounce is under a haste effect, and it charges, does it get the extra attack from haste?

Yes. This is a revised ruling about how haste interacts with effects that are essentially a full attack, even though the creature isn’t specifically using the full attack action (as required by haste). The earlier ruling implied that pounce did not allow the extra attack from haste because pounce wasn’t using the full attack action.

\[[Source](http://paizo.com/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1fo#v5748eaic9r4l)\]

When a creature with this special attack makes a [charge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Charge), it can make a full attack (including rake attacks if the creature also has the rake ability).

*Format*: pounce; *Location*: Special Attacks.

### Powerful Charge (Ex)

When a creature with this special attack makes a [charge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Charge), its attack deals extra damage in addition to the normal benefits and hazards of a [charge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Charge). The attack and amount of damage from the attack is given in the creature’s description.

*Format*: powerful charge (gore, 4d8+24); *Location*: Special Attacks.

### Psychic Magic (Sp)

**Source** [PRG:OB](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1601257678/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1601257678&linkCode=as2&tag=httpwwwd20pfs-20&linkId=NZXU3XBU465PLWZ3)

A creature with this ability can use the power of its mind to cast certain spells. Each spell cast using psychic magic consumes an amount of psychic energy. The creature has a maximum amount of psychic energy (PE) per day that refreshes after a night’s rest. A creature with this ability can cast any of the spells listed in this entry as long as it has enough psychic energy remaining to pay the spell’s PE cost. The DC for any of these spells is equal to 10 + the amount of psychic energy used to cast the spell + the creature’s [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-) or [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-) modifier (whichever is higher). Creatures that gain access to undercast spells via this ability can cast an undercast version of the spell by spending 1 PE fewer for each level lower that the spell is cast. A psychic magic spell with a PE cost of 0 can be cast any number of times, and can be cast even if the creature has 0 PE remaining. The psychic magic granted by this ability has the same thought and emotion [components](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components) as psychic spells. The monster can apply [metamagic feats](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats) to these spells by spending an amount of additional PE equal to the level increase of the [metamagic feat](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats) and by increasing the [casting time](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Casting-Time) as normal for spontaneously casting a [metamagic](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats) spell. Because this ability grants psychic spellcasting, it also allows the creature to use occult skill unlocks.

*Format*: Psychic Magic (Sp) (CL 10th; [concentration](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration) +14) 12 PE—[charm person](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/charm-person) (1 PE, DC 14), [disguise self](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/disguise-self) (2 PE), mind thrust III (3 PE, DC 16), tower of iron will I (5 PE); *Location*: Before [Spell-Like Abilities](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-).

Psychic Resilience (Ex): Creatures with this ability are resistant to the effects of many psychic spells. They gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against all psychic spells.

*Format*: +4 vs. psychic spells; *Location*: After saves and in defensive abilities.

### Pull (Ex)

A creature with this ability can choose to make a free [combat maneuver](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers) check with a successful attack. If successful, this check pulls a creature closer. The distance pulled is set by this ability. The type of attack that causes the pull and the distance pulled are included in the creature’s description. This ability only works on creatures of a size equal to or smaller than the pulling creature. Creatures pulled in this way do not provoke [attacks of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) and stop if the pull would move them into a solid object or creature.

*Format*: pull (tentacle, 5 feet); *Location*: Special Attacks and individual attacks.

### Push (Ex)

A creature with the push ability can choose to make a free [combat maneuver](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers) check with a certain successful attack (often a slam attack). If successful, this check pushes a creature directly away as with a [bull rush](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Bull-Rush), but the distance moved is set by this ability. The type of attack that causes the push and the distance pushed are included in the creature’s description. This ability only works on creatures of a size equal to or Smaller than the pushing creature. Creatures pushed in this way do not provoke [attacks of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) and stop if the push would move them into a solid object or creature.

*Format*: push (slam, 10 feet); *Location*: Special Attacks and individual attacks.

### Rake (Ex)

A creature with this special attack gains extra natural attacks under certain conditions, typically when it grapples its foe. In addition to the options available to all grapplers, a monster with the rake ability gains two free claw attacks that it can use only against a [grappled](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled) foe. The bonus and damage caused by these attacks is included in the creature’s description. A monster with the rake ability must begin its turn already [grappling](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple) to use its rake—it can’t begin a [grapple](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple) and rake in the same turn.

*Format*: rake (2 claws +8, 1d4+2); *Location*: Special Attacks.

### Recuperation \[MA\] (Ex)

The creature is restored to full [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) after 8 hours of rest so long as it isn’t [dead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead). In addition, by expending one use of [Mythic Power](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic-Power) and resting for 1 hour, it regains a number of [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) equal to half its full [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) (up to a maximum of its full [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points)) and regain the use of any class features that are limited to a certain number of uses per day (such as [barbarian](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian) rage, [bardic performance](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard#TOC-Bardic-Performance), spells per day, and so on). This rest is treated as 8 hours of sleep for such abilities. This rest doesn’t refresh uses of [Mythic Power](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic-Power) or any [Mythic](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic) abilities that are limited to a number of times per day.

*Format*: recuperation; *Location*: SQ.

### Regeneration (Ex)

A creature with this ability is difficult to kill. Creatures with regeneration heal damage at a fixed rate, as with [fast healing](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Fast-Healing-Ex-), but they cannot die as long as their regeneration is still functioning (although creatures with regeneration still fall [unconscious](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious) when their [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) are below 0). Certain attack forms, typically fire and acid, cause a creature’s regeneration to stop functioning on the round following the attack. During this round, the creature does not heal any damage and can die normally. The creature’s descriptive text describes the types of damage that cause the regeneration to cease functioning.

Attack forms that don’t deal hit point damage are not healed by regeneration. [Regeneration](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Regeneration-Ex-) also does not restore [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation. Regenerating creatures can regrow lost portions of their bodies and can reattach severed limbs or body parts if they are brought together within 1 hour of severing. Severed parts that are not reattached wither and die normally.

A creature must have a [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) score to have the regeneration ability.

*Format*: regeneration 5 (fire, acid); *Location*: hp.

### Rend (Ex)

If it hits with two or more natural attacks in 1 round, a creature with the rend special attack can cause tremendous damage by latching onto the opponent’s body and tearing flesh. This attack deals an additional amount of damage, but no more than once per round. The type of attacks that must hit and the additional damage are included in the creature’s description. The additional damage is usually equal to the damage caused by one of the attacks plus 1-1/2 times the creature’s [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) bonus.

*Format*: rend (2 claws, 1d8+9); *Location*: Special Attacks.

### Resistance (Ex)

A creature with this special quality ignores some damage of the indicated type each time it takes damage of that kind (commonly acid, cold, electricity, or fire). The entry indicates the amount and type of damage ignored.

*Format*: **Resist** acid 10; *Location*: Defensive Abilities.

### Rock Catching (Ex)

The creature (which must be of at least Large size) can catch Small, Medium, or Large rocks (or projectiles of similar shape). Once per round, a creature that would normally be hit by a rock can make a [Reflex](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex) save to catch it as a free action. The DC is 15 for a Small rock, 20 for a Medium one, and 25 for a Large one. (If the projectile provides a magical bonus on attack rolls, the DC increases by that amount.) The creature must be aware of the attack in order to make a rock catching attempt.

*Format*: rock catching; *Location*: Defensive Abilities.

### Rock Throwing (Ex)

This creature is an accomplished rock thrower and has a +1 [racial bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus) on attack rolls with thrown rocks. A creature can hurl rocks up to two categories smaller than its size; for example, a Large hill giant can hurl Small rocks. A “rock” is any large, bulky, and relatively regularly shaped object made of any material with a hardness of at least 5. The creature can hurl the rock up to five range increments. The size of the range increment varies with the creature. Damage from a thrown rock is generally twice the creature’s base slam damage plus 1-1/2 times its [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) bonus.

*Format*: rock throwing (120 ft.); *Location*: Special Attacks (damage is listed in Ranged attack).

### Scent (Ex)

This special quality allows a creature to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. Creatures with the scent ability can identify familiar odors just as humans do familiar sights.

The creature can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at triple normal range.

When a creature detects a scent, the exact location of the source is not revealed—only its presence somewhere within range. The creature can take a move action to note the direction of the scent. When the creature is within 5 feet of the source, it pinpoints the source’s location.

A creature with the scent ability can follow tracks by smell, making a [Wisdom](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-) (or [Survival](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival)) check to find or follow a track. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10 (no matter what kind of surface holds the scent). This DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the quarry’s odor is, the number of creatures, and the age of the trail. For each hour that the trail is cold, the DC increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows the rules for the Survival skill. Creatures tracking by scent ignore the effects of surface conditions and poor visibility.

*Format*: scent; *Location*: Senses.

### See in Darkness (Su)

The creature can see perfectly in darkness of any kind, including that created by [deeper darkness](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/deeper-darkness).

*Format*: see in darkness; *Location*: Senses.

### Smother (Ex)

If the creature’s opponent is holding its breath, the creature can reduce the time until the target has to attempt suffocation checks. As a [free action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions), the creature can attempt a [grapple](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple) [combat maneuver](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers) against the opponent. If it succeeds, the opponent reduces the remaining duration it can hold its breath by 1d6 rounds.

*Format*: smother; *Location*: Special Attacks.

### Sound Mimicry (Ex)

The creature perfectly imitates certain sounds or even specific voices. The creature makes a [Bluff](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/bluff) check opposed by the listener’s [Sense Motive](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/sense-motive) check to recognize the mimicry, although if the listener isn’t familiar with the person or type of creatures mimicked, it takes a –8 penalty on its [Sense Motive](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/sense-motive) check. The creature has a +8 [racial bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus) on its [Bluff](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/bluff) check to mimic sounds (including accents and speech patterns, if a voice mimic) it has listened to for at least 10 minutes. The creature cannot duplicate the effects of magical abilities (such as bardic performance or a harpy’s captivating song), though it may be able to mimic the sound of those abilities. This ability does not allow the creature to speak or understand languages it doesn’t know.

*Format*: sound mimicry (voices); *Location*: Special Qualities.

### Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)

Spell-like abilities are magical and work just like spells (though they are not spells and so have no verbal, somatic, focus, or material [components](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components)). They go away in an [antimagic field](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/antimagic-field) and are subject to spell resistance if the spell the ability is based on would be subject to spell resistance.

A spell-like ability usually has a limit on how often it can be used. A constant spell-like ability or one that can be used at will has no use limit; unless otherwise stated, a creature can only use a constant spell-like ability on itself. Reactivating a constant spell-like ability is a [swift action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions). Using all other spell-like abilities is a standard action unless noted otherwise, and doing so provokes [attacks of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity). It is possible to make a [concentration](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration) check to use a spell-like ability defensively and avoid provoking an attack of opportunity, just as when casting a spell. A spell-like ability can be disrupted just as a spell can be. Spell-like abilities cannot be used to [counterspell](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Counterspells), nor can they be counterspelled.

For creatures with spell-like abilities, a designated caster level defines how difficult it is to dispel their spell-like effects and to define any level-dependent variables (such as range and duration) the abilities might have. The creature’s caster level never affects which spell-like abilities the creature has; sometimes the given caster level is lower than the level a spellcasting character would need to cast the spell of the same name. If no caster level is specified, the caster level is equal to the creature’s [Hit Dice](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-). The [saving throw](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws) (if any) against a spell-like ability is 10 + the level of the spell the ability resembles or duplicates + the creature’s [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-) modifier.

Some spell-like abilities duplicate spells that work differently when cast by characters of different classes. A monster’s spell-like abilities are presumed to be the [sorcerer/wizard](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/spell-lists-and-domains/spell-lists-sorcerer-and-wizard/) versions. If the spell in question is not a sorcerer/wizard spell, then default to [cleric](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric), [druid](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid), [bard](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard), [paladin](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/paladin), and [ranger](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger), in that order.

*Format*: At will—[burning hands](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/burning-hands) (DC 13); *Location*: Spell-Like Abilities.

### Spell Resistance (Ex)

A creature with spell resistance can avoid the effects of spells and [spell-like abilities](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-) that directly affect it. To determine if a spell or spell-like ability works against a creature with spell resistance, the caster must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level). If the result equals or exceeds the creature’s spell resistance, the spell works normally, although the creature is still allowed a [saving throw](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws).

*Format*: **SR** 18; *Location*: Defensive Abilities.

### Split (Ex)

The creature splits into two identical copies of itself if subject to certain attacks or effects. Each copy has half the original’s current [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) (rounded down). A creature reduced below the listed hit points cannot be further split and can be killed normally.

*Format*: split (piercing and slashing, 10 hp); *Location*: Defensive Abilities.

### Stench (Ex)

A creature with the stench special ability secretes an oily chemical that nearly every other creature finds offensive. All living creatures (except those with the stench special ability) within 30 feet must succeed on a [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) save (DC 10 + 1/2 stench creature’s racial [HD](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-) + stench creature’s [Con](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature’s descriptive text) or be [sickened](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Sickened). The duration of the sickened condition is given in the creature’s descriptive text. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same creature’s stench for 24 hours. A [delay poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/delay-poison) or [neutralize poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/n/neutralize-poison) spell removes the effect from the sickened creature. Creatures with [immunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-) to [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions#TOC-Poison) are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their [saving throws](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws).

*Format*: stench (DC 15, 10 rounds); *Location*: Aura.

### Strangle (Ex)

An opponent [grappled](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled) by the creature cannot speak or cast spells with verbal [components](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components).

*Format*: strangle; *Location*: Special Attacks.

### Summon (Sp)

A creature with the summon ability can summon other specific creatures of its kind much as though casting a [summon monster](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/summon-monster) spell, but it usually has only a limited chance of success (as specified in the creature’s entry). Roll d%: On a failure, no creature answers the summons. Summoned creatures automatically return whence they came after 1 hour. A creature summoned in this way cannot use any spells or [spell-like abilities](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-) that require material [components](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components) costing more than 1 gp unless those [components](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components) are supplied, nor can it use its own summon ability for 1 hour. An appropriate spell level is given for each summoning ability for purposes of [Will](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will) saves, caster level checks, and [concentration](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration) checks. No [experience points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Experience-Points-XP-) are awarded for defeating summoned monsters.

*Format*: 1/day—summon (level 4, 1 hezrou 35%); *Location*: Spell-Like Abilities.

### Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex)

If the creature is in sunlight (but not in an area of [daylight](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/daylight) or similar spells), it cannot attack and is [staggered](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered).

*Format*: sunlight powerlessness; *Location*: Weaknesses.

### Surge \[MA\] (Su)

The creature can call upon its [Mythic Power](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic-Power) to overcome difficult challenges. It can expend one use of [Mythic Power](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic-Power) to increase any d20 roll it just made by rolling a die and adding it to the result. Using this ability is an [immediate action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions) taken after the original roll is made and the results are revealed. The bonus die depends on the creature’s [Mythic Rank](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic-Rank). The monster can use this ability even if it’s mindless or of animal-level intelligence.

Surge doesn’t have a separate entry in the monster stat block—the Surge die is listed in the [Mythic Power](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic-Power) ability.

### Swallow Whole (Ex)

For the Swallow Whole ability, once you’ve dealt enough damage to a monster’s insides, what kind of action is required to escape?

A swallowed character must use a [standard action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions), [move action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions), or [5-foot-step](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Take-5-Foot-Step) to escape. This applies whether the acting character is the one who cut his way free or another swallowed character making use the exit carved by another character.

\[[Source](http://paizo.com/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1fo#v5748eaic9qft)\]

If a creature with this special attack begins its turn with an opponent [grappled](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled) in its mouth (see [Grab](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Grab-Ex-)), it can attempt a new [combat maneuver](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers) check (as though attempting to [pin](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Pinned) the opponent). If it succeeds, it swallows its prey, and the opponent takes bite damage. Unless otherwise noted, the opponent can be up to one size category Smaller than the swallowing creature. Being swallowed causes a creature to take damage each round. The amount and type of damage varies and is given in the creature’s statistics. A swallowed creature keeps the [grappled](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled) condition, while the creature that did the swallowing does not. A swallowed creature can try to cut its way free with any light slashing or piercing weapon (the amount of cutting damage required to get free is equal to 1/10 the creature’s total [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points)), or it can just try to escape the [grapple](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple). The [Armor Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class) of the interior of a creature that swallows whole is normally 10 + 1/2 its [natural armor bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Natural-Armor-Bonus), with no modifiers for size or [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-). If a swallowed creature cuts its way out, the swallowing creature cannot use swallow whole again until the damage is healed. If the swallowed creature escapes the [grapple](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple), success puts it back in the attacker’s mouth, where it may be bitten or swallowed again.

*Format*: swallow whole (5d6 acid damage, AC 15, 18 hp); *Location*: Special Attacks.

### Telepathy (Su)

The creature can mentally communicate with any other creature within a certain range (specified in the creature’s entry, usually 100 feet) that has a language. It is possible to address multiple creatures at once telepathically, although maintaining a telepathic conversation with more than one creature at a time is just as difficult as simultaneously speaking and listening to multiple people at the same time

*Format*: telepathy 100 ft.; *Location*: Languages.

### Thoughtsense (Su)

**Source** [PRG:OB](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1601257678/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1601257678&linkCode=as2&tag=httpwwwd20pfs-20&linkId=NZXU3XBU465PLWZ3)

Creatures with this ability automatically detect and locate conscious creatures within the specified range (usually 60 feet). This ability functions similarly to [blindsight](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Blindsight-and-Blindsense). [Nondetection](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/n/nondetection), [mind blank](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/mind-blank), and similar effects can block thoughtsense.

Thoughtsense can distinguish between sentient ([Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-) 3 or greater) and non-sentient ([Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-) 1–2) creatures, but otherwise provides no information about the creatures it detects.

*Format*: thoughtsense 60 ft.; *Location*: Senses.

### Trample (Ex)

As a full-round action, a creature with the [trample](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/trample-combat) ability can attempt to [overrun](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Overrun) any creature that is at least one size category Smaller than itself. This works just like the [overrun](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Overrun) [combat maneuver](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers), but the trampling creature does not need to make a check, it merely has to move over opponents in its path. Targets of a [trample](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/trample-combat) take an amount of damage equal to the trampling creature’s slam damage + 1-1/2 times its [Str](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) modifier. Targets of a [trample](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/trample-combat) can make an [attack of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity), but at a –4 penalty. If targets forgo an [attack of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity), they can attempt to avoid the trampling creature and receive a [Reflex](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex) save to take half damage. The save DC against a creature’s [trample](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/trample-combat) attack is 10 + 1/2 the creature’s [HD](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-) + the creature’s [Str](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) modifier (the exact DC is given in the creature’s descriptive text). A trampling creature can only deal trampling damage to each target once per round, no matter how many times its movement takes it over a target creature.

*Format*: trample (2d6+9, DC 20); *Location*: Special Attacks.

### Tremorsense (Ex)

A creature with [tremorsense](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Tremorsense) is sensitive to vibrations in the ground and can automatically pinpoint the location of anything that is in contact with the ground. [Aquatic](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Aquatic) creatures with [tremorsense](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Tremorsense) can also sense the location of creatures moving through water. The ability’s range is specified in the creature’s descriptive text.

*Format*: [tremorsense](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Tremorsense) 60 ft.; *Location*: Senses.

### Trip (Ex)

A creature with the trip special attack can attempt to [trip](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Trip) its opponent as a free action without provoking an [attack of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) if it hits with the specified attack. If the attempt fails, the creature is not [tripped](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Trip) in return.

*Format*: trip (bite); *Location*: individual attacks.

### Undead Traits (Ex)

[Undead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead) are immune to death effects, [disease](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions#TOC-Diseases), mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, morale effects, phantasms, and patterns), [paralysis](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Paralysis), [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions#TOC-Poison), sleep, [stun](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned), and any effect that requires a [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) save (unless the effect also works on objects or is harmless). [Undead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead) are not subject to [ability drain](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Ability-Damage-and-Drain-Ex-or-Su-), [energy drain](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/energy-drain), or [nonlethal damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage). [Undead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead) are immune to damage or penalties to their physical ability scores ([Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-), [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-), and [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-)), as well as to [fatigue](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fatigued) and exhaustion effects. [Undead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead) are not at risk of death from massive damage.

*Format*: undead traits; *Location*: Immune.

### Undersized Weapons (Ex)

The creature uses manufactured weapons as if it were one size category Smaller than the creature’s actual size.

*Format*: undersized weapons; *Location*: Special Qualities.

### Unnatural Aura (Su)

Animals do not willingly approach the creature unless the animal’s master makes a DC 25 [Handle Animal](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/handle-animal), [Ride](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/ride), or [wild empathy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid#TOC-Wild-Empathy-Ex-) check.

*Format*: unnatural aura (30 ft.); *Location*: Aura.

### Unstoppable \[MA\] (Ex)

The creature can expend one use of [Mythic Power](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic-Power) as a [free action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions) to immediately end any one of the following conditions currently affecting it: [bleed](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/bleed), [blind](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Blinded), [confused](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Confused), [cowering](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Cowering), [dazed](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dazed), [dazzled](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dazzled), [deafened](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Deafened), [entangled](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Entangled), [exhausted](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Exhausted), [fascinated](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fascinated), [fatigued](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fatigued), [frightened](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Frightened), [nauseated](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated), [panicked](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Panicked), [paralyzed](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Paralyzed), [shaken](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Shaken), [sickened](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Sickened), [staggered](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered), or [stunned](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned). All other conditions and effects remain, even those resulting from the same spell or effect that caused the selected condition. It can use this ability at the start of its turn even if a condition would prevent it from acting.

*Format*: unstoppable; *Location*: Defensive Abilities.

### Vulnerabilities (Ex or Su)

A creature with vulnerabilities takes half again as much damage (+50%) from a specific energy type, regardless of whether a [saving throw](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws) is allowed or if the save is a success or failure. Creatures with a vulnerability that is not an energy type instead take a –4 penalty on saves against spells and effects that cause or use the listed vulnerability (such as spells with the light descriptor). Some creatures might suffer additional effects, as noted in their descriptions.

*Format*: vulnerability to fire; *Location*: Weaknesses.

### Water Breathing (Ex)

A creature with this special ability can breathe underwater indefinitely. It can freely use any breath weapon, spells, or other abilities while submerged.

*Format*: water breathing; *Location*: SQ.

### Water Dependency (Ex)

A creature with this special ability can survive out of water for 1 minute per point of Constitution. Beyond this limit, this creature runs the risk of suffocation, as if it were drowning.



*Format*: water dependency; *Location*: SQ.

### Web (Ex)

Creatures with the web ability can use webs to support themselves and up to one additional creature of the same size. In addition, such creatures can throw a web up to eight times per day. This is similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 50 feet, with a range increment of 10 feet, and is effective against targets up to one size category larger than the web spinner. An [entangled](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Entangled) creature can escape with a successful [Escape Artist](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/escape-artist) check or burst the web with a [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) check. Both are standard actions with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the creature’s [HD](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-) + the creature’s [Con](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) modifier. Attempts to burst a web by those caught in it take a –4 penalty.

Web spinners can create sheets of sticky webbing up to three times their size. They usually position these sheets to snare flying creatures but can also try to trap prey on the ground. Approaching creatures must succeed on a DC 20 [Perception](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception) check to notice a web; otherwise they stumble into it and become trapped as though by a successful web attack. Attempts to escape or burst the webbing gain a +5 bonus if the trapped creature has something to walk on or grab while pulling free. Each 5-foot-square section of web has a number of [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) equal to the [Hit Dice](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-) of the creature that created it and DR 5/—.

A creature can move across its own web at its climb speed and can pinpoint the location of any creature touching its web.

*Format*: web (+8 ranged, DC 16, 5 hp); *Location*: Special Attacks.

### Whirlwind (Su)

Some creatures can transform themselves into whirlwinds and remain in that form for up to 1 round for every 2 [HD](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-) they have. If the creature has a fly speed, it can continue to fly at that same speed while in whirlwind form; otherwise it gains a fly speed equal to its base land speed (average maneuverability) while in whirlwind form.

The whirlwind is always 5 feet wide at its base, but its height and width at the top vary from creature to creature (minimum 10 feet high). A whirlwind’s width at its peak is always equal to half of its height. The creature controls the exact height, but it must be at least 10 feet high.

The whirlwind form does not provoke [attacks of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity), even if the creature enters the space another creature occupies. Another creature might be caught in the whirlwind if it touches or enters the whirlwind, or if the whirlwind moves into or through the creature’s space. A creature in whirlwind form cannot make its normal attacks and does not threaten the area around it.

Creatures one or more size categories smaller than the whirlwind might take damage when caught in the whirlwind (generally damage equal to the monster’s slam attack for a creature of its size) and may be lifted into the air. An affected creature must succeed on a [Reflex](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex) save (DC 10 + half monster’s [HD](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-) + the monster’s [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) modifier) when it comes into contact with the whirlwind or take damage as if it were hit by the whirlwind creature’s slam attack. It must also succeed on a second [Reflex](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex) save or be picked up bodily and held suspended in the powerful winds, automatically taking the indicated damage each round. A creature that can fly is allowed a [Reflex](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex) save each round to escape the whirlwind. The creature still takes damage but can leave if the save is successful.

Creatures trapped in the whirlwind cannot move except to go where the whirlwind carries them or to escape the whirlwind. Trapped creatures can otherwise act normally, but must succeed on a [concentration](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration) check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell. Creatures caught in the whirlwind take a –4 penalty to [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-) and a –2 penalty on attack rolls. The whirlwind can have only as many creatures trapped inside at one time as will fit inside the whirlwind’s volume. The whirlwind can eject any carried creatures whenever it wishes as a free action, depositing them in its space.

If the whirlwind’s base touches the ground, it creates a swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the creature and has a diameter equal to half the whirlwind’s height. The cloud obscures all vision, including [darkvision](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Darkvision), beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have [concealment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment), while those farther away have total [concealment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment). Those caught in the cloud of debris must succeed on a [concentration](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration) check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell.

*Format*: whirlwind (3/day, 10–30 ft. high, 1d6+6 damage, DC 15); *Location*: Special Attacks.
