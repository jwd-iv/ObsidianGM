# Ascalaphus - Clarification of Perception and Awareness in Pathfinder

There are three interlocking concepts to distinguish. Once you've got a good sense of how they interact, it's easy to remember them. There are:

\- Senses  
\- States of awareness  
\- Hindrances to perception

Let's start with the hindrances. There are two: **cover** and **concealment**. They don't actually stop you from observing, they just make it work a little less good, and as a result, the person you're observing can try to hide. This is different from PF1/Starfinder where concealment was sort of half wedged into the states of awareness. Not the case in PF2 anymore.

Then we have states of awareness. There's four, and all of them are subjective. That means that someone is aware to some degree of you; you're not objectively "hidden", you're "hidden to him", and not "observed", you're "observed by her". This is different from most conditions which are more objective.

**Unnoticed** they don't even know you're in this scene at all.  
**Undetected** they know you're in this scene, but not where.  
**Hidden** they can't directly perceive you with a precise sense, but they know where you are (which square).  
**Observed** They can directly perceive you with a precise sense. You might still have cover or concealment.

These states are neatly linked with the three degrees of senses:

**Vague** senses just tell you someone is there in the scene, not where. For most people, smell is a vague sense. If there's a swamp ghoul crouching quietly behind your couch you can't see it, can't hear it, so it's Undetected. But because you can smell rotting plants you know something is not right, and the ghoul is therefore not Unnoticed.

**Imprecise** senses allow you to localize creatures so that they're Hidden instead of Undetected. If the ghoul starts scampering around, still outside of your sight, you can hear it moving around behind your couch. It's now only Hidden. Your dog however, also has Scent as an imprecise sense. Your dog knew where the ghoul was before it started making any noises. Because the ghoul is still Hidden you could toss a flask of holy water in that direction but you'd have to roll a flat check DC 11 to target a Hidden creature.

**Precise** senses not only allow you to do what imprecise and vague senses do, but they also allow you to Observe. When the ghoul comes out from behind the couch and you can see it, you can attack it without having to roll a flat check for it being Hidden.

So this is the basic layout of these states. How do you move between them? With Stealth, mostly. And a bit of help from the terrain maybe.

If you're trying to stop being Observed by a precise sense, you need some kind of concealment or cover from that precise sense. Usually people only have sight as a precise sense so something opaque will do. Some bushes that obscure your full silhouette for example. This is why spells like Blur have to say that you can't use them to hide, because they don't actually create something in between you and the subject. Anyway if you have something that makes you a bit harder to see then you can use Stealth to Hide. Of course if you have something that completely makes it impossible to see you, then you don't even have to do that. If the ghoul walks out of the room around the corner then the wall completely blocks your line of sight and it's now Hidden. It didn't have to roll Stealth to Hide for that. Likewise, drinking an Invisibility potion will immediately make you Hidden because it stops people from using sight to observe you precisely.

It's actually similar with trying to counter imprecise senses, but here the goal is to go from Hidden to Undetected. See, the CRB says that the default is that with an imprecise sense people are Hidden, unless they're taking actions to Sneak. Basically, if you can't see someone but can hear them, and they're not trying to walk softly, then you can hear sort of where they are. They can use the Sneak action of the Stealth skill to move softly, and when they succeed, then you don't know where they moved to so now they're Undetected.

Guard dogs make a lot of sense because walking really quietly doesn't make you smell any better. The rules for other senses say that someone has to be doing something specifically to foil them. You could get some scent-blocking alchemical items to be able to bypass a dog's sense of smell. Or get the Foil Senses stealth skill feat. But against a lot of enemies, these senses will just work. If you're a gnome with the Sensate heritage, you'll automatically know where invisible enemies are unless they took special steps. Which makes it easy for you to drop some faerie fire in the right area.

Of course all this could go out of the window in specific areas. If you're in the middle of a slaughterhouse then your imprecise scent probably doesn't work. If you have a fight near a roaring waterfall, you can't use hearing to keep track of enemies that you can't see. And if it's pitch black at night, you the human can't see the ghouls coming out from behind your couch.

To recap & memorize:

**Vague senses** can only "notice" someone is there which moves them from **Unnoticed** to **Undetected**.  
**Imprecise senses** can pinpoint where an **Undetected** subject is to make it only **Hidden**.  
**Precise senses** can directly **Observe** subjects.

**Cover & Concealment** allow an **Observed** subject to **Hide** to become **Hidden**.

A **Hidden** subject can **Sneak** to move elsewhere so that they become **Undetected** because you no longer know where they are.
