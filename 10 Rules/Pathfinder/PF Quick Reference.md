| <sup>1</sup> Regardless of the action, if you move out of a [threatened](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Threatened-Squares) square, you usually provoke an [attack of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity). This column indicates whether the action itself, not moving, provokes an [attack of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity). |
| <sup>2</sup> If you aid someone performing an action that would normally provoke an [attack of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity), then the act of aiding another provokes an [attack of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) as well. |
| <sup>3</sup> If you have a [base attack bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus) of +1 or higher, you can combine one of these actions with a regular move. If you have the [Two-Weapon Fighting](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/two-weapon-fighting-combat) feat, you can draw two light or one-handed weapons in the time it would normally take you to draw one. |

| <sup>5</sup> Unless the component is an extremely large or awkward item. |
| <sup>6</sup> Some [combat maneuvers](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers) substitute for a melee attack, not an action. As melee attacks, they can be used once in an attack or [charge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Charge) action, one or more times in a full-attack action, or even as an [attack of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity). Others are used as a separate action. |
