SpecialAbilities:
  Cloud Form (Su): >
    An adult or older cloud dragon can change itself into a cloudy vapor as a swift action for a number of rounds per day equal to its Hit Dice. This ability functions as gaseous form but the dragon's fly speed is unchanged.
  Cloud Breath (Su): >
    A great wyrm cloud dragon's breath weapon creates a cloud that persists in its cone shape for 1d4 rounds. Treat this cloud as a fog cloud that deals electricity damage equal to half the dragon's breath weapon damage to any creature that ends its turn still within the cloud (Reflex save halves the damage-DC equals the dragon's breath weapon save DC).
  Mist Vision (Su): >
    A cloud dragon can see through fog, clouds, and similar obscuring effects with perfect clarity.
  Spell-Like Abilities (Sp): >
    A cloud dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will (unless indicated otherwise) on reaching the listed age category. Very young-obscuring mist; Young-fog cloud; Adult-solid fog; Old-cloudkill (3/day); Ancient-wind walk; Great wyrm-storm of vengeance (1/day).
  Thundering Bite (Su): >
    An ancient or older cloud dragon's bite makes a thundering crash whenever it attacks, dealing an additional 2d6 points of sonic damage. A great wyrm's thundering bite deals an additional 4d6 sonic damage.

Description: Cloud dragons stay out of the complicated political schemes and obsessions of other dragons (especially the chromatic dragons), preferring to live their lives freely and as the whim to travel strikes them. Exploration and viewing new lands from far above are the cloud dragon's greatest joy, rivaled only by speaking with new creatures and gaining exotic treasures from them. They keep lairs on high mountain peaks, but are often away on journeys of discovery, returning home only when they've claimed a new treasure that needs to be placed in safekeeping back home.
