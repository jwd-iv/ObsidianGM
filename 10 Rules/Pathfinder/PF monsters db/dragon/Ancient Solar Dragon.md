SpecialAbilities:
  Alien Presence (Su): >
    A creature that fails its saving throw against a solar dragon's alien presence is blinded for 5d6 rounds (or permanently if it has 4 Hit Dice or fewer).
  Beam of Light (Su): >
    A great wyrm solar dragon can transform itself into a beam of pure light and travel to any location it can see as a move action. This travel must be in a straight line, but otherwise the dragon can travel anywhere that light can enter.
  Channel Life (Su): >
    A solar dragon can channel positive energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + its Charisma modifier, using its age category + 2 as its cleric level. This energy can be used only to heal living creatures.
  Channel Radiation (Su): >
    An old or older solar dragon can use its channel life ability to instead channel radiation that deals an equal amount of damage to living creatures. A living creature that succeeds at a Fortitude save takes half damage.
  Primal Fire (Su): >
    A very young or older solar dragon's breath weapon can affect creatures normally immune or resistant to fire damage. A creature immune to fire damage still takes half damage from the breath weapon (no damage with a successful saving throw). A resistant creature's fire resistance is treated as 10 less than normal.
