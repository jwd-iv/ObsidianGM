SQ: superheated
SpecialAbilities:
  Magma Tomb (Su): >
    Once per day, a great wyrm magma dragon can spit lava onto a target within 120 feet, dealing damage normally for its breath weapon. This magma cools instantly-it does not continue doing damage at this point but does entrap the victim (see universal monster rules in appendix; DC equals the dragon's breath weapon save DC, 3d6 minutes, hardness 8, hp 45).
  Magma Breath (Su): >
    Three times per day, an ancient or older magma dragon can breathe a cone of lava instead of fire. The damage is unchanged, but the magma clings to those it damages, dealing half damage each round thereafter for 1d3 rounds. After this magma cools, it crumbles to dust.
  Spell-Like Abilities (Sp): >
    A magma dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will (unless indicated otherwise) on reaching the listed age category. Very young-burning hands; Juvenile-scorching ray; Adult- wall of fire; Old-fire shield (warm shield, constant); Ancient-delayed blast fireball (3/day); Great wyrm-wall of lava^[This spell is from the Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide].
  Superheated (Su): >
    At young age and older, a magma dragon's bite attack deals additional fire damage equal to its age category.

Description: Temperamental and prone to violent outbursts, magma dragons are regarded by most other dragons as dangerously insane-an assumption that, more often than not, proves correct. One can rarely predict a magma dragon's state of mind until it either attacks or attempts to engage in conversation. For their part, magma dragons can justify all of their actions-they just rarely feel the need to do so.
