    Good or evil creatures take a -2 penalty when making saving throws against a sovereign dragon's spells, spell-like abilities, breath weapon, and aura.
  Golden Armor (Su): >
    Once per day as a standard action, an old or older sovereign dragon can cover its form in golden armor, granting it a +4 armor bonus to AC and energy resistance 15 to one energy type, chosen at the time the armor is summoned. This armor lasts for a number of rounds equal to the dragon's age category. The sovereign dragon can dismiss the armor as a free action.
  Master Counterspelling (Su): >
