SpecialAbilities:
  Breath Weapon (Su): >
    Although it deals negative energy damage, an umbral dragon's breath weapon does not heal undead creatures.
  Create Shadows (Su): >
    Any creature slain by an ancient or older umbral dragon rises as a shadow (if 8 HD or less) or greater shadow (if above 8 HD) under the umbral dragon's control 1d4 rounds later.
  Energy Drain (Su): >
    A great wyrm umbral dragon deals 1 negative level with each successful bite or claw attack (1 level, DC 32).
  Ghost Bane (Su): >
    A young or older umbral dragon's physical attacks deal damage to incorporeal creatures normally.
  Shadow Breath (Su): >
    Three times per day, an adult or older umbral dragon can breathe a cone of shadows. Creatures who fail a Fortitude save are blinded for 1d4 rounds and take 1 point of Str drain per age category possessed by the dragon. A successful save negates the blindness and reduces Str drain to 1d4 points.
  Umbral Scion (Ex): >
    Umbral dragons have negative energy affinity and are immune to energy drain and death effects.
