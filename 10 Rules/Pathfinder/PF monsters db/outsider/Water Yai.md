SpecialAbilities:
  Acidic Missile (Su): >
    As a swift action, a water yai can launch a bolt of acid from its third eye. Any creature struck by this bolt must also succeed at a DC 29 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round by the overwhelming stench of the acid. This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Flowing Robes (Su): >
    A water yai wears a special silk kimono  infused with magical water. This kimono grants a +6 armor bonus. These robes function as armor only for water yai.
  Liquid Form (Sp): >
    As a standard action, a water yai can turn into a mobile pool of water. This functions like gaseous form, except that the yai cannot fly in this form. It retains its own base speed, and its swim speed doubles to 120 feet. The water yai can end this ability as a standard action.

Description: The water yai clad themselves in the flesh of storm giants, yet these yai are more at home dwelling beneath the waves than they are above them. Unlike most oni, water yai have no real longing to rule or infiltrate societies- yet they still enjoy posing as humanoids. They often assume the forms of enormous merfolk in the water, but prefer to adopt the shapes of storm giants when on land. The water yai then pursues its favorite decadence-the acclimation of material wealth and luxuries. Water yai tend to be easily distracted by beautiful treasures, and despite their evil natures are prone to acts of unexpected frivolity.
