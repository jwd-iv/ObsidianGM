SpecialAbilities:
  Fear Aura (Su): >
    A creature of fewer than 10 Hit Dice that fails its save (DC 17) against the vanth's fear aura is shaken for as long as it remains within the aura. A creature that succeeds at its save is immune to that vanth's aura for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Reaper's Scythe (Su): >
    Every vanth carries a distinctive adamantine scythe as both a weapon and a symbol of its duty. When the vanth wields its own scythe, the weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls. As a free action, the vanth can summon its weapon from a personal demiplane or any other location and have it appear in its hands instantly. It can also dismiss its scythe back to its personal demiplane as a free action. If a vanth's scythe is destroyed, it can summon a new one in 24 hours.

Description: Stern, silent, and cloaked in ragged black wings, vanth psychopomps serve as stoic guardians of Purgatory and watchers along the routes of the dead. A vanth looks like a black skeleton with ravenlike wings and a mask resembling a vulture's skull. Also known as reapers, angels of death, or amzranei, vanths protect the departed from those wishing to eat or steal their mortal souls, recapture escaped souls trying to flee their assigned fates, and are death's foot soldiers against whatever would disrupt the natural cycle of mortality. They may also guard the dead and death's assets, such as forgotten cemeteries, unattended mausoleums, and sacred groves. A vanth weighs 400 pounds and stands 8 feet tall, though its slumped posture means it can look most adult humanoids in the eye. Vanths are ancient creatures, perhaps predating the current gods of death, and are rumored to be ascended souls of a distant world of death-worshiping soldiers. They rarely speak or show emotion and their hollow voices carry unnaturally far. A vanth's scythe is a badge of its station, ref lecting its role as a harvester of souls. It features symbols in a language that was already lost when the death gods claimed Purgatory. Most outsiders scorn vanths, as the psychopomps have no concern for law, rightfulness, or personal gain- only duty. Vanths view any outsider visiting Purgatory as a potential threat, and stalk angels and demons alike.
