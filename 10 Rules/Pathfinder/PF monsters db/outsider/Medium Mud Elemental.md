SpecialAbilities:
  Earth Glide (Ex): >
    A burrowing mud elemental can pass through dirt, gravel, or other loose or porous solid matter as easily as a fish swims through water. It cannot use this ability to pass through a solid barrier such as a stone or brick wall. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing mud elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.
  Entrap (Ex): >
    The mud from an elemental's entrap ability can be washed away in 1d3 rounds of immersion in water.

Where the Plane of Earth borders the Plane of Water, a mixing of the fundamental elements occurs-it is in this borderland that the mud elementals dwell. Scorned by earth and water elementals, mud elementals usually look like vaguely recognizable blobs of mud in the shape of a Material Plane creature, whether a humanoid, an animal, or even an immense insect. The exact density of their muddy bodies varies-some might be composed of silty water, while others are thick, like river clay. Large and powerful mud elementals tend to have worm-like, reptilian, or frog-like forms.
