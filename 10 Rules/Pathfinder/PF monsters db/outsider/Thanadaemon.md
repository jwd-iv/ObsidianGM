SpecialAbilities:
  Draining Weapon (Su): >
    A thanadaemon's energy drain attack functions through any melee weapon it wields.
  Fear Gaze (Su): >
    Cower in fear for 1d6 rounds, 30 feet, Will DC 21 negates. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Soul Crush (Su): >
    A thanadaemon can crush a soul gem (see cacodaemon) as a standard action to gain fast healing 15 for 15 rounds (this is a standard action).  This action condemns the crushed soul to Abaddon- resurrecting this victim requires a DC 28 caster level check.

While all daemons represent death in some fashion, thanadaemons, the Deacons of Death, represent the inevitable death through old age. Thanadaemons effortlessly work eerie skiffs along every pus- and bile-choked river in Abaddon, including the legendary River Styx. For the right price (typically 50 pp or 2 gems worth at least 300 gp each), a thanadaemon will even carry passengers on its skiff, yet those who travel with these fiends should beware-they frequently renegotiate the terms once they've got their passengers in dangerous realms.
