SpecialAbilities:
  Sprint (Ex): >
    Once per minute, a shadow demon increase its fly speed to 240 feet for 1 round.
  Shadow Blend (Su): >
    During any conditions other than bright light, a shadow demon can disappear into the shadows as a moveequivalent action, effectively becoming invisible. Artificial illumination or light spells of 2nd level or lower do not negate this ability.
  Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex): >
    A shadow demon is utterly powerless in bright light or natural sunlight and flees from it. A shadow demon caught in such light cannot attack and can take only a single move or standard action. A shadow demon that is possessing a creature using magic jar is not harmed by sunlight, but if it is struck by a sunbeam or sunburst spell while possessing a creature, the shadow demon is driven out of its host automatically.

Description: Tales of demonic possession are common, used often by the ignorant to explain strange or violent behavior. While the majority of such cases are merely manifestations of madness or derangement, those that are legitimate possessions are often the work of shadow demons. Unlike many demons, shadow demons are incorporeal. When a particularly envious and evil mortal soul is pulled into the Abyss, it is transformed, split apart, and combined with other souls until what emerges is little more than jealous malevolence without the impediment of a physical body.
