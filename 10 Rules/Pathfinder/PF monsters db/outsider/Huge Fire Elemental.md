Fire elementals are quick, cruel creatures of living flame. They enjoy frightening beings weaker than themselves, and terrorizing any creature they can set on fire. A fire elemental cannot enter water or any other nonf lammable liquid. A body of water is an impassible barrier unless the fire elemental can step or jump over it or the water is covered with a flammable material (such as a layer of oil). Fire elementals vary in appearance-they usually manifest as coiling serpentine forms made of smoke and lame, but some fire elementals take on shapes more akin to humans, demons, or other monsters in order to increase the terror of their sudden appearance. Features on a fire elemental's body are made by darker bits of flame or patches of semi-stable smoke, ash, and cinders. Elemental Height Weight Small 4 ft. 1 lb. Medium 8 ft. 2 lbs. Large 16 ft. 4 lbs. Huge 32 ft. 8 lbs. Greater 36 ft. 10 lbs. Elder 40 ft. 12 lbs.
