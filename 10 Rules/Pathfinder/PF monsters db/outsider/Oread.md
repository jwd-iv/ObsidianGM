Oreads are humans whose ancestry includes the touch of an elemental being of earth somewhere along its line, often that of a shaitan genie. Oreads are strong and solidly built, and prefer wearing earth tones that match the coloration of their flesh and hair-shades of gray, brown, black, or white. In rare cases, oreads' stone-like traits are so strong as to leave no question as to their nature, with growths like rocky outcroppings protruding from their skin or hair like crystalline spikes.  Oreads tend to be stoic and contemplative, slow to anger but terrible when roused. Outside of combat, they tend to be quiet, dependable, and protective of their friends.  OREAD CHARACTERS  Oreads are defined by class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. Oreads have the following racial traits.  +2 Strength, +2 Wisdom, -2 Charisma: Oreads are strong, solid, stable, and stoic.  Darkvision: Oreads can see in the dark up to 60 feet.  Spell-Like Ability: Magic stone 1/day (caster level equals the oread's total Hit Dice).  Energy Resistance: Oreads have acid resistance 5.  Earth Affinity: See above.  Languages: Oreads begin play speaking Common and Terran. Oreads with high Intelligence scores can choose any of the following bonus languages: Aquan, Auran, Dwarven, Elven, Gnome, Half ling, Ignan, and Undercommon.
