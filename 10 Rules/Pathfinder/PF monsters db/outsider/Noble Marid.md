SpecialAbilities:
  Water Mastery (Ex): >
    A noble marid gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its opponent are touching water. If the opponent or the noble marid is touching the ground, the noble marid takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls.
  Water's Fury (Su): >
    As a standard action, a noble marid can release a jet of water in a 60-foot line that deals 1d6 points of damage and blinds the target struck for 1d6 rounds. A DC 21 Reflex save reduces the damage by half and negates the blinding effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Vortex (Su): >
    A noble marid can transform into a vortex of swirling, churning water once every 10 mintues. This ability functions identically to the whirlwind ability, save that it can only be used while the noble marid is underwater; a noble marid cannot leave a body of water while in vortex form.

Description: Marids are genies from the Plane of Water. The most powerful of all the genie races, they are said to possess the strength of the ocean's currents and teeth made of pearl. A marid stands about 16 feet tall and weighs nearly 2,500 pounds. The marids are perhaps the most unpredictable and capricious of the genies, a quality that the others (particularly shaitans) find to be both aggravating and embarrassing to the entire genie culture. Many marids become dancers, storytellers, performers, or other types of artists, and often travel to the Material Plane in disguise to seek out new audiences.
