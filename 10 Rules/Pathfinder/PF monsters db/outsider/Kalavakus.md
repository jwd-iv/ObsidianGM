SpecialAbilities:
  Enslave Soul (Su): >
    A kalavakus can attempt to enslave the soul of any mortal creature within 60 feet as a swift action. The kalavakus must have line of sight to the target.  The target can resist this special attack with a DC 18 Will save, but is staggered for 1 round even if the save is successful. If the save is successful, the creature is immune to this ability for 24 hours. If the save is a failure, the target's soul is enslaved-this creature takes a -6 penalty on all attack rolls and saving throws against that kalavakus. If a creature with an enslaved soul is slain by that kalavakus, the soul immediately infuses the demon's body, affecting it with a heal spell (CL 12th). A kalavakus can have only one mortal soul enslaved at a time-if it enslaves a second soul, the first is released. This is a mind-affecting death effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Horns (Ex): >
    The kalavakus's numerous horns can easily catch weapons and yank them away from opponents. The demon gains a +4 racial bonus on all disarm attempts as a result.

Known to some as "horned demons," the kalavakus demons are hulking, muscled beasts. They work as slavers on the Abyss, sometimes as harem keepers or captains of the guard for a more powerful demon, and at other times as mercenaries who sell their captured victims for profit to anyone with the funds to pay.  A kalavakus is 7 feet tall and weighs 450 pounds. They form from the souls of evil mortals who were slavers in their mortal lives.
