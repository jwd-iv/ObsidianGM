SpecialAbilities:
  Ability Drain (Su): >
    A thulgant's stingers each drain a different ability score on a hit. One stinger drains 1d4 points of Strength, another drains 1d4 points of Dexterity, and the third drains 1d4 points of Charisma. Any sting's drain is negated by a DC 29 Fortitude save. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Demon Hunter (Ex): >
    A thulgant gains a +10 racial bonus on caster level checks to penetrate the spell resistance of any demon. Its attacks are treated as cold iron and good against demons.
  Horrific Appearance (Su): >
    Creatures that succumb to a thulgant's horrific appearance are stunned for 1d4 rounds and take 1d6 points of Wisdom damage.
  Savage Stingers (Ex): >
    If a thulgant hits a single target with all three stings in the same round, it tears through the victim's body, dealing an extra 3d6+12 points of damage and draining an additional 2 ability points from all six of the victim's ability scores. A single DC 29 Fortitude save negates all of this additional ability drain. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Description: The dreaded thulgant is among the most dangerous of the qlippoth, for it supports an array of deadly and painful physical attacks with a wide range of potent magical powers. Born from the cannibalistic orgies of augnagar qlippoth, each thulgant exists for one purpose only-the eradication of all demons from the Abyss.  Yet thulgants do not spend all of their lives hunting and destroying demons. They rule horrific hives deep in the Abyss populated by all manner of hideous minions, many of which are bound into servitude via binding spells. These qlippoth are fond of decorating their lairs with petrified or enstasised victims of great power-the more powerful the victims, the greater the prestige held by the thulgant.
