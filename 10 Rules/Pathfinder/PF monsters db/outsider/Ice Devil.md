SpecialAbilities:
  Slow (Su): >
    A hit from an ice devil's tail or spear induces numbing cold. The opponent must succeed on a DC 23 Fortitude save or be affected as though by a slow spell for 1d6 rounds. This effect comes from the devil in the case of its weapon; it is not a quality possessed by the spear itself.  The save DC is Constitution-based.

Description: Strategists and masterminds of Hell's armies, the insectile ice devils possess some of the most cruelly ingenious minds in Asmodeus's legions. It is said that each ice devil-known as gelugons among the ranks of devilkind-bears within its chest a stolen, frozen mortal heart, which allows it to make decisions free of all emotion. Born on the icy layer of Cocytus, Hell's seventh layer, most ice devils migrate to Caina, the eighth layer, where they plot world-damning machinations from courts of freezing steel. Although they are perhaps the most alien and monstrous in appearance of all devils, few breeds are accorded greater respect.  In combat, a gelugon prefers to let its minions engage foes in melee so that it can hang back and appraise the foe's tactics, strengths, and weaknesses. The ice devil supports its minions with its spell-like abilities, always taking care to avoid impacting its minions in the area of effect of its spells-this not from any sense of camaraderie, only a cold and logical truth that its allies can survive longer in a fight if they are not exposed to friendly fire.  Gelugons stand at 12 feet tall, and weigh approximately 700 pounds.
