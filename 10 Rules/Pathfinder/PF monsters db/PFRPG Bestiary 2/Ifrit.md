Description: >
  Ifrits are humans whose ancestry includes beings of elemental fire, such as efreet. Ifrits have pointed ears, red or mottled horns on the brow, and hair that flickers and waves as if it were af lame.  All ifrits are at some level pyromaniacs. Adoring fire in all its forms, they tend to be passionate and quick to action, with a predilection for striking first in any conf lict-a trait which keeps them alive but doesn't make them a lot of friends. Ifrits generally seek out the company of either less-powerful minions who can be browbeaten into following orders, or calm, cool individuals who can balance the ifrits out.  IFRIT CHARACTERS  Ifrits are defined by class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. Ifrits have the following racial traits.  +2 Dexterity, +2 Charisma, -2 Wisdom: Ifrits are passionate and quick, but also impetuous and destructive.  Darkvision: Ifrits can see in the dark up to 60 feet.  Spell-Like Ability: Burning hands 1/day (caster level equals the ifrit's total Hit Dice).  Energy Resistance: Ifrits have fire resistance 5.  Fire Affinity: See above.  Languages: Ifrits begin play speaking Common and Ignan. Ifrits with high Intelligence scores can choose any of the following bonus languages: Aquan, Auran, Dwarven, Elven, Gnome, Half ling, and Terran.
