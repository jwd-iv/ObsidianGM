SQ: 
SpecialAbilities:
  Horrific Appearance (Su): >
    Creatures that succumb to an augnagar's horrific appearance are driven momentarily insane. This results in 2 points of Charisma damage and leaves the victim confused for 1d3 rounds.
  Rotting Curse (Su): >
    : Bite- injury; Save Fort DC 26; Frequency 1/ day; Effect 1d6 Con drain plus constant stench. A creature that suffers the rotting curse imparted by an augnagar's bite displays hideous, festering wounds that exude a horrific stench. This functions as the stench universal monster rule (see page 302), save that it affects all creatures except those that are immune to poison. The victim of this curse receives no saving throw to avoid becoming sickened by the stench, but other creatures can attempt a DC 26 Fortitude save to negate this condition-those who fail remain sickened as long as they remain within 30 feet of the cursed victim. The horrific stench also imparts a -8 penalty on all Stealth checks made by the cursed victim. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Description: The immense augnagar is relatively slow-witted. As an outsider, it does not need to eat to survive, yet it remains ravenous and feeds on anything it can overpower. The augnagar prefers the taste of well-rotted flesh- particularly rotted demon flesh-and the horrific curse its bite imparts flavors its meals perfectly. Yet the augnagar's favorite feast is of a much more cannibalistic type. These creatures find the flesh of their own kind to be the greatest delicacy. When an augnagar feeds upon enough of its own kind, it grows enormously bloated such that it can no longer fly, at which point it uses its clawed tails to tear its body apart in a frenzy of self-destruction. From this storm of torn fat and shredded viscera emerges a fully grown thulgant qlippoth-a creature similar in shape to an augnagar, yet much more intelligent and even more dangerous.  An augnagar has a wingspan of 30 feet and weighs 6,000 pounds.
