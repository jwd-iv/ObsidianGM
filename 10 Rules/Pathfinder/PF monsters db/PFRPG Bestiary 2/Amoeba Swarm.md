Description: An amoeba swarm is a mobile group of amoebas, each about the size of a coin. Giant amoebas may cleave off tiny portions of their substance, which can then become amoeba swarms. At other times, a giant amoeba can spontaneously transform into a swarm, usually if the giant amoeba is starving or in an area with a high concentration of magic. Likewise, a well-fed amoeba swarm may fuse into a single giant amoeba.  When an amoeba swarm is found in the vicinity of a giant amoeba, the two oozes ignore each other. A giant amoeba in the space of an amoeba swarm takes no damage from the swarm's attacks and does not run the risk of becoming distracted as a result of being in the swarm.
