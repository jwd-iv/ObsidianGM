SpecialAbilities:
  Razor Sharp (Sp): >
    All of a crystal dragon's natural attacks deal slashing damage.
  Ray Reflection (Ex): >
    An ancient crystal dragon's scales reflect ray spells back upon the ray's source if the ray fails to overcome the dragon's spell resistance.
  Scintillating Aura (Su): >
    A great wyrm crystal dragon radiates an aura of scintillating color from its jeweled scales to a radius of 60 feet. All within this area must make a Will save each round to avoid being stunned (if the victim has 15 or fewer Hit Dice) or confused (if the victim has more than 15 Hit Dice) for 1 round. The save DC is equal to the dragon's breath weapon save DC. This is a mind-affecting effect. The dragon can activate or suppress this aura as a free action.

Very young-color spray; Juvenile-glitterdust; Adult-rainbow pattern; Old- stone to flesh (3/day); Ancient-prismatic spray (3/day); Great wyrm-imprisonment (1/day).
  Tremorsense (Ex): >

Description: Crystal dragons are generally good-natured, though their incredible vanity sometimes causes them to seem aloof and cocky. Any perceived insult against its appearance is all but assured to send a crystal dragon into a rage-which is a problem, as most crystal dragons are prone to seeing insults even where none are intended. Crystal dragons prefer underground lairs, and often go for decades or even centuries without emerging from their extensive cavern lairs onto the surface world above.  Crystal dragons tend to be exacting and even obsessive-compulsive, their personalities mirroring the precise and ordered nature of the facets of their scales. A crystal dragon's lair is a well-ordered place-these dragons find the very idea of the classic sprawl of a dragon's hoard to be shameful.
