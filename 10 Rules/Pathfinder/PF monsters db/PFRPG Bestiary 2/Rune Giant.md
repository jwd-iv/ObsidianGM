SpecialAbilities:
  Command Giant (Su): >
    A rune giant gains a +4 racial bonus on the save DC of charm or compulsion effects used against giants.
  Runes (Ex): >
    As a free action, whenever a rune giant uses its spark shower or spell-like abilities, it can cause the runes on its body to flash with light. All creatures within 10 feet of the giant must make a DC 24 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1 round. The saving throw is Charisma-based.
  Spark Shower (Su): >
    As a standard action, a rune giant can cause a shower of sparks to erupt out of one of the runes on its body. These sparks function as a breath weapon (30-ft.  cone; 10d6 fire and 10d6 electricity damage; Reflex DC 29 half; usable once every 1d4 rounds). The save DC is Constitution-based.

Description: Magically crafted and crossbred from taiga and fire giant slaves by ancient wizards, rune giants are anathema to their own kind.  Given power to command and magically control other giants, the rune giants themselves served their even more powerful masters, and in so doing granted ancient empires armies of giants to command.  In the eons since these ancient empires collapsed, rune giants have persisted as a race of their own, little more than bogeymen, horrors whispered of late at night by superstitious giants.  Rune giants' charcoal flesh is decorated by dozens of runes-manifestations of their eldritch powers. Rune giants are 40 feet tall and weigh 25,000 pounds.
