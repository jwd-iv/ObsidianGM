  Cloud Form (Su): >

  Cloud Breath (Su): >
    A great wyrm cloud dragon's breath weapon creates a cloud that persists in its cone shape for 1d4 rounds. Treat this cloud as a fog cloud that deals electricity damage equal to half the dragon's breath weapon damage to any creature that ends its turn still within the cloud (Reflex save halves the damage-DC equals the dragon's breath weapon save DC).

Description: Cloud dragons stay out of the complicated political schemes and obsessions of other dragons (especially the chromatic dragons), preferring to live their lives freely and as the whim to travel strikes them. Exploration and viewing new lands from far above are the cloud dragon's greatest joy, rivaled only by speaking with new creatures and gaining exotic treasures from them. They keep lairs on high mountain peaks, but are often away on journeys of discovery, returning home only when they've claimed a new treasure that needs to be placed in safekeeping back home.
