SpecialAbilities:
  Fireball Breath (Su): >
    A flame drake can, as a standard action, breathe a ball of flame that explodes like a fireball. This attack has a range of 180 feet and deals 5d6 points of fire damage (DC 16 Reflex half) to all creatures within a 20-foot-radius spread. Once a flame drake has used its fireball breath, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Speed Surge (Ex): >
    Three times per day as a swift action, a flame drake may draw on its draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed to take an additional move action in that round.

Description: Flame drakes are the degenerate cousins of red dragons, with all of the rage and temper of true red dragons but little of the reason and intelligence. Flame drakes are brutal bullies who terrorize the lands they inhabit.  From those they can frighten, flame drakes exact harsh tribute, and they viciously attack any not so easily cowed.  Flame drakes gather in small hunting packs called "rampages," working together easily during raids but often falling prey to squabbling and infighting over the spoils. Males and females form their own packs divided by gender, coming together only during the annual mating season.  Flame drakes mate once a year. Males play no part in raising their offspring, and abandon their partners soon after mating. Females lay clutches of two or three eggs in secluded mountain nests, and raise their hatchlings for only 2 years before rejoining their packs and abandoning their offspring to their fates. Flame drakes mature in 5 years, and can live up to 150 years. They generally grow to 12 feet long and weigh 1,500 pounds.
