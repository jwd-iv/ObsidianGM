SpecialAbilities:
  Cold (Su): >
    A creature touching a frost wight with natural weapons or unarmed strikes takes 1d6 cold damage.
  Create Spawn (Su): >
    Any humanoid creature that is slain by a wight becomes a wight itself in only 1d4 rounds. Spawn so created are less powerful than typical wights, and suffer a -2 penalty on all d20 rolls and checks, as well as -2 hp per HD. Spawn are under the command of the wight that created them and remain enslaved until its death, at which point they lose their spawn penalties and become full-fledged and free-willed wights. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.
  Resurrection Vulnerability (Su): >
    A raise dead or similar spell cast on a wight destroys it (Will negates). Using the spell in this way does not require a material component.

Description: Wights are humanoids who rise as undead due to necromancy, a violent death, or an extremely malevolent personality. In some cases, a wight arises when an evil undead spirit permanently bonds with a corpse, often the corpse of a slain warrior. They are barely recognizable to those who knew them in life; their flesh is twisted by evil and undeath, the eyes burn with hatred, and the teeth become beast-like. In some ways, a wight bridges the gap between a ghoul and a spectre-a warped animated corpse whose touch steals living energy.
