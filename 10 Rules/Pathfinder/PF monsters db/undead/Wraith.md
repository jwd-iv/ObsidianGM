SpecialAbilities:
  Create Spawn (Su): >
    A humanoid slain by a wraith becomes a wraith in 1d4 rounds. These spawn are less powerful than typical wraiths, and suffer a -2 penalty on all d20 rolls and checks, receive -2 hp per HD, and only drain 1d2 points of Constitution on a touch. Spawn are under the command of the wraith that created them until its death, at which point they lose their spawn penalties and become free-willed wraiths. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.
  Constitution Drain (Su): >
    Creatures hit by a wraith's touch attack must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Constitution drain. On each successful attack, the wraith gains 5 temporary hit points. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Lifesense (Su): >
    A wraith notices and locates living creatures within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight ability.
  Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex): >
    A wraith caught in sunlight cannot attack and is staggered.
  Unnatural Aura (Su): >
    Animals do not willingly approach within 30 feet of a wraith, unless a master makes a DC 25 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check.

Description: Wraiths are undead creatures born of evil and darkness. They hate light and living things, as they have lost much of their connection to their former lives. Dread Wraith A wraith that exists for long enough and feeds on enough life force undergoes an unholy transformation, becoming a creature known as a dread wraith. This causes the wraith to increase in size and strength, and to inf lict 2d6 points of negative energy damage and 1d8 Constitution drain with its incorporeal touch. You can create a dread wraith by applying the giant and advanced simple templates, or you can increase the basic wraith to a Large 16 HD undead.
