Description: >
  The ankylosaurus is a powerful, squat dinosaur more than capable of defending itself against enemies. Its back is heavily armored with thick bony plates and spikes. A solid blow from an ankylosaurus's tail can leave most creatures stunned long enough for the armored dinosaur to make good an escape, although once confronted, most ankylosauruses are too ill-tempered and stubborn to flee. Instead, they stand their ground and use their tails to great effect in battle. An ankylosaurus is 30 feet long and weighs 6,000 pounds.
