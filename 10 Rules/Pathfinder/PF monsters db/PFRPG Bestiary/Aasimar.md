Description: >
  Aasimars are humans with a signif icant amount of celestial or other good outsider blood in their ancestry. Aasimars are not always good, but it is a natural tendency for them, and they gravitate to good faiths or organizations associated with celestials. Aasimar heritage can hide for generations, only to appear suddenly in the child of two apparently human parents. Most societies interpret aasimar births as good omens. Aasimars look mostly human except for some minor physical trait that reveals their unusual heritage. Typical aasimar features are hair that shines like metal, unusual eye or skin color, or even glowing golden halos. Aasimar Characters Aasimars are defined by class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. Aasimars have the following racial traits. +2 Charisma, +2 Wisdom: Aasimars are insightful, confident, and personable. Normal Speed: Aasimars have a base speed of 30 feet. Darkvision: Aasimars can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Skilled: Aasimars have a +2 racial bonus on Diplomacy and Perception checks. Spell-Like Ability: Aasimars can use daylight once per day as a spell-like ability (caster level equals the aasimar's class level). Celestial Resistance: Aasimars have acid resistance 5, cold resistance 5, and electricity resistance 5. Languages: Aasimars begin play speaking Common and Celestial. Aasimars with high Intelligence scores can choose any of the following bonus languages: Draconic, Dwarven, Elven, Gnome, Half ling, and Sylvan.
