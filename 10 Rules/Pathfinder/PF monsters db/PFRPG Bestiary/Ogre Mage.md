Description: >
  The ogre mage, like all oni, is an evil spirit come to the Material Plane and clad in living flesh-in this case, that of a brutish ogre. Ogre mages are often found serving as leaders of ogre tribes, yet not all of them seek to link their destinies to their less-intelligent kin. Some become lone marauders who hold villages hostage, demanding regular tribute in the form of gold, food, or maidens, lest they take more than they ask. Oni Traits The oni are a diverse race of evil outsiders, of which the ogre mage is the most common. Other types of oni exist as well-evil spirits that clothe themselves in the flesh of other types of humanoid. The majority of oni are giants, with goblinoid, tengu, and reptilian oni being relatively common as well. While oni are incredibly varied in their shapes and powers, they still share certain traits in common. • Regeneration: All oni regenerate, although the rate of regeneration varies. Damage from fire or acid can kill an oni. • Change Shape: All oni are shapechangers, but their ability to change shape is generally limited to creatures similar in shape to their true form. • Native: Oni are native outsiders. As evil spirits clad in mortal humanoid flesh, all oni also possess one of the humanoid subtypes-usually giant.
