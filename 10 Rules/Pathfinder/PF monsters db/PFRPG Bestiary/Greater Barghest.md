SpecialAbilities:
  Feed (Su): >
    Once per month, a barghest can devour a nonevil humanoid's corpse as a full-round action to gain a growth point. It gains a bonus equal to its growth point total on attack rolls, CMB rolls, saving throws, and skill checks. Its maximum hit points increase by 5 for each growth point it gains. For every 2 growth points, a barghest's caster level for its spell-like abilities and its CR increase by +1. When a barghest reaches 4 growth points, it sheds its skin and becomes a greater barghest, losing all of its growth points (and bonuses) but gaining the stats presented on this page for a greater barghest.

Description: Said to be fiendish relations of all goblinoid races, the hateful barghests come to the Material Plane to feed. As they consume the bodies of innocents, they grow increasingly powerful. A barghest eventually sheds its skin to transform into a greater barghest, at which point it often seeks out a tribe of goblins or other creatures to rule.
