  Smoke (Su): >
    In battle, a nightmare exhales smoke that chokes and blinds foes, filling a 15-foot cone each round as a free action.  Anyone in the cone must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or become sickened until 1d6 minutes after leaving the area. This smoke acts as obscuring mist for the purposes of concealment. The smoke persists for 1 round.  The save DC is Constitution-based.

Description: Nightmares are flaming harbingers of death. They allow only the most evil of creatures to ride them, and are never mere mounts, but rather willing partners in destruction.
