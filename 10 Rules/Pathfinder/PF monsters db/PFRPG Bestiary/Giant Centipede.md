Description: Giant centipedes attack nearly any living creatures with their poisonous jaws. These creatures adapt to many environments and feed voraciously on the local fauna, including humanoids. The coloration of giant centipedes mirrors that of normal centipedes and spans the spectrum, ranging from dull hues to bright reds and fiery oranges. Other species of giant centipedes exist as well, some smaller but most quite a bit larger. You can adjust the stats given here by changing Hit Dice and size (changing Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution as appropriate) to represent a wide range of giant centipede species. The following table lists the most common variants.
