SpecialAbilities:
  Drench (Ex): >
    The elemental's touch puts out nonmagical flames of Large size or smaller. The creature can dispel magical fire it touches as dispel magic (caster level equals elemental's HD).
  Vortex (Su): >
    A water elemental can create a whirlpool as a standard action, at will. This ability functions identically to the whirlwind special attack (see page 306), but can only form underwater and cannot leave the water.
  Water Mastery (Ex): >
    A water elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its opponent are touching water. If the opponent or the elemental is touching the ground, the elemental takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether the elemental is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks.

Description: Water elementals are patient, relentless creatures made of living fresh or salt water. They prefer to hide or drag their opponents into the water to gain an advantage. As with other elementals, all water elementals have their own unique shapes and appearances. Most appear as wave-like creatures with vaguely humanoid faces and smaller wave "arms" to either side. Another common form is that of any aquatic creature, such as a shark or octopus, but made entirely out of water. Elemental Height Weight Vortex Save DC Vortex Height Small 4 ft. 34 lbs. 13 10-20 ft.
