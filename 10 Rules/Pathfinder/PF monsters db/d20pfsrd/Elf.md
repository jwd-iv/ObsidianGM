  Generally taller than humans, elves possess a graceful, slender

  Elves are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial HD. They

  nimble, both in body and mind, but their form is frail. They gain +2
  Dexterity, +2 Intelligence, and -2 Constitution.  • Size: Elves are Medium
  creatures and thus receive no bonuses or penalties due to their size.  • Type:
  Elves are Humanoids with the elf subtype.  • Base Speed: Elves have a base
  speed of 30 feet.  • Languages: Elves begin play speaking Common and Elven.
  Elves with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following: Celestial,
  Draconic, Gnoll, Gnome, Goblin, Orc, and Sylvan. See the Linguistics skill
  page for more information about these languages.  • Elven Immunities: Elves
  are immune to magic sleep effects and gain a +2 racial saving throw bonus
  against enchantment spells and effects.   • Keen Senses: Elves receive a +2
  racial bonus on Perception checks.   • Elven Magic: Elves receive a +2 racial
  bonus on caster level checks made to overcome spell resistance. In addition,
  elves receive a +2 racial bonus on Spellcraft skill checks made to identify
  the properties of magic items.   • Weapon Familiarity: Elves are proficient
  with longbows (including composite longbows), longswords, rapiers, and
  shortbows (including composite shortbows), and treat any weapon with the word
  "elven" in its name as a martial weapon.  • Low-Light Vision: Elves can see
  twice as far as humans in conditions of dim light.
