Brief: This barbaric humanoid bears ragged equipment and armor in sullen colors.
  It has coarse body hair and a stooped posture like some primitive man but with
  a grayish-green skin tone and bestial facial features beneath a black hood.
  Burning red eyes peer below a low, sloping brow, just above a flattened nose,
  and prominent tusk-like teeth.

Description: As seen by civilized races, half-orcs are monstrosities, the result
  of perversion and violence-whether or not this is actually true. Half-orcs are
  rarely the result of loving unions, and as such are usually forced to grow up
  hard and fast, constantly fighting for protection or to make names for
  themselves. Half-orcs as a whole resent this treatment, and rather than play
  the part of the victim, they tend to lash out, unknowingly confirming the
  biases of those around them. A few feared, distrusted, and spat-upon half-orcs
  manage to surprise their detractors with great deeds and unexpected
  wisdom-though sometimes it's easier just to crack a few skulls. Some half-orcs
  spend their entire lives proving to full-blooded orcs that they are just as
  fierce. Others opt for trying to blend into human society, constantly
  demonstrating that they aren't monsters. Their need to always prove themselves
  worthy encourages half-orcs to strive for power and greatness within the
  society around them.
