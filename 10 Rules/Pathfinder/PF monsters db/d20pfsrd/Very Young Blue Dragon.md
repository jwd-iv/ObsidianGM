  Desert Thirst (Su): >

Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC 16) or be destroyed.
  Sound Imitation (Ex): >
    A very young or older blue dragon can mimic any voice or sound it has heard by making a successful Bluff check against a listener's Sense Motive check.

Description: Blue dragons are consummate schemers and obsessively orderly. In combat, blue dragons prefer to surprise foes if possible, and are not above retreating if the odds turn against them. They prefer to lair near those that they control, sometimes even within the confines of a city.
