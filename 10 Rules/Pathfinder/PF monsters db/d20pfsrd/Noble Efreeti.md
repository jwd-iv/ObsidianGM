SpecialAbilities: Change Size (Sp)Twice per day, a noble efreeti can magically change a creature's size. This works just like an enlarge person or reduce person spell (the efreeti chooses when using the ability), except that the ability can work on the efreeti. A DC 13 Fortitude save negates the effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. This is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell. Heat (Ex)An noble efreeti's body deals 1d6 points of fire damage whenever it hits in melee, or in each round it grapples.

Description: The efreet (singular efreeti) are genies from the Plane of Fire. An efreeti stands about 12 feet tall and weighs about 2,000 pounds.  Efreet have few allies among geniekind. They certainly hate djinn, and attack them on sight. They hold an equally strong enmity for marids, and view the jann as frail and weak. Efreet often work closely with shaitans, yet even then alliances are temporary at best.
