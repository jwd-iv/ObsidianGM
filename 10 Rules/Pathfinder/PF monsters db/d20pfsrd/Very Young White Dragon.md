SQ: icewalking
SpecialAbilities: Icewalking (Ex) This ability works like the spider climb spell, but the surfaces the dragon climbs must be icy. The dragon can move across icy surfaces without penalty and does not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice.  Snow Vision (Ex) A very young white dragon learns to see perfectly well in snowy conditions. A white dragon does not suffer any penalties to Perception checks while in snow.

Description: Although most consider it to be the weakest and most feral of the chromatic dragons, the white dragon makes up for its lack of cunning with sheer ferocity. White dragons dwell on remote, frozen mountaintops and in arctic lowlands, making their home in glittering caves full of ice and snow. They prefer their meals completely frozen.
