SpecialAbilities:
  Change Shape (Su): >
    A very young or older gold dragon can assume any animal or humanoid form three times per day as if using polymorph.
  Detect Gems (Sp): >
    A young or older gold dragon can detect gems three times per day. This functions as locate object, but can only be used to locate gemstones.
  Fast Flight (Ex): >
    A young or older gold dragon is treated as one size category larger when determining his fly speed.
  Fire Aura (Su): >
    An old or older gold dragon is surrounded by an aura of fire. All creatures within 5 feet of the dragon take 1d6 points of fire damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn. An ancient gold dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. A great wyrm's damage increases to 2d6. The dragon can activate or suppress this aura as a free action.
  Luck (Sp): >
    Once per day an adult or older gold dragon can touch a gem, usually one embedded in the dragon's hide, and enspell it to bring good luck. As long as the dragon carries the gem, it and every good creature within a given radius of it (10 ft. per age category) receives a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws. If the dragon gives an enspelled gem to another creature, only that bearer gets the bonus. The effect lasts 1d3 hours plus 3 hours per age category of the dragon. This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.
  Weakening Breath (Su): >
    Instead of a cone of fire, a gold dragon can breathe a cone of weakening gas. Creatures within the cone must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1 point of Strength damage per age category (Will save half).
