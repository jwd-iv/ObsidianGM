SpecialAbilities:
  Martial Proficiency (Ex): >
    Sinspawn are proficient in all simple and martial weapons, armor, and shields (except tower shields).
  Sin-Scent (Su): >
    Sinspawn have scent against creatures whose nature reflects the sinspawn's sin. For example, wrathful sinspawn can scent creatures using rage effects. The GM should adjudicate what creatures a particular sinspawn can scent.
  Sinful Bite (Su): >
    A creature bitten by a sinspawn is overwhelmed with sinful thoughts (DC 12 Will save negates). These emotions are so powerful that the target becomes sickened for 1d6 minutes. An affected target that is bitten a second time is staggered for 1 round if it fails its saving throw. Calm emotions, remove curse, or break enchantment negates the effects of sinful bite. The save DC is Charisma-based. This is a mind-affecting effect.

Description: >
  Sinspawn are corrupted products of magic used by spellcasters in a past era as shock troops for their armies.  Literally the embodiment of a sin made flesh, they are sentient abominations of distilled ectoplasm imprinted with the soul-image of slain creatures that possessed an abundance of a particular sin.  Seven Types of Sinspawn The above stats represent a wrathspawn, the most common type of this creature. Each type possesses unique ability modifiers, which are listed after their name.  Envyspawn (+2 Str, -2 Cha): Short and thin, envyspawn often become rangers.  Gluttonspawn (+2 Con, -2 Dex): Obese yet hardy and strong, gluttonspawn often become fighters.  Greedspawn (+2 Dex, -2 Wis): Towering over 7 feet in height, greedspawn have gold-tinged veins and often become rogues.  Lustspawn (+4 Cha, -2 Con, -2 Wis): With perfectly formed bodies sitting in grotesque counterpoint to their monstrous faces and claws, lustspawn often become sorcerers.  Pridespawn (+4 Int, -2 Wis, -2 Cha): Unique among sinspawn for their long manes of hair, pridespawn are near-skeletal in their gauntness. They often become wizards.  Slothspawn (+2 Wis, -2 Dex): Thick rolls of excess skin drape a slothspawn's hunched frame. They often become clerics.  Wrathspawn: These sinspawn use the statistics given above. They often become barbarians.
