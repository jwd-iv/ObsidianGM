SpecialAbilities:
  Drain Memory (Su): >
    Once per day as a standard action, a hyakume can make a touch attack with either its hands or one of its eye probes to drain a target of its memories. The target loses the majority of memories relating to life and identity, and the hyakume can control the creature as if it were subject to a charm monster spell until those memories are regained (Will DC 28 negates). The hyakume absorbs the memories and can store and use them. It can store the memories of a number of creatures equal to its Intelligence bonus (typically 4) at one time. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Eye Probe (Su): >
    Once per day as a full-round action, a hyakume can detach up to six of its eyes and send them on missions. An eyeball has AC 22, hp 5, and a fly speed of 60 ft. with perfect maneuverability. A hyakume can see through all of its eye probes, and can make drain memory attacks with them. If a hyakume's eyeball is destroyed, the hyakume takes 5 points of damage. An eye probe can't stray farther than 1 mile from a hyakume or the eye is destroyed (dealing 5 points of damage).  Monk Abilities The hyakume's Stunning Fist feat and slam attacks function as though it were a 15th-level monk. It can also use the quivering palm class feature once per day (Fortitude DC 25). The save DC is Wisdom-based.
  Transfer Memories (Su): >
    Once per day as a standard action, a hyakume can touch a willing creature with either its hand or one of its eye probes to transfer memories it has stored to the creature touched. This is a mind-affecting effect.

Hideous and corpulent, with numerous eyes dotting their bodies, hyakumes are mystics of malevolence. They steal and collect the memories of other intelligent beings to increase their own knowledge.
