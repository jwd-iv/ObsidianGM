  Crippling Bite (Ex): >
    A slicer beetle's bite attack threatens a critical hit on a roll of 19-20. If a slicer beetle scores a critical hit on a target, its mandibles cut deep, resulting in a wound that causes 1d6 bleed and leaving its foe staggered for 1d3 rounds from the tremendous pain dealt.

Description: The slicer beetle sports specialized mouthparts that scissor apart flesh for easier consumption. Each side of its horizontally closing mandibles fits into the other with barely a hair's breadth to spare. These creatures prefer to dwell in compact caves or warrens.  A typical slicer beetle measures 10 feet long and weighs 800 pounds.
