Description: >
  A typical antelope stands a bit less than 3 feet at the shoulder, measures 4 feet in length, and weighs 60 pounds. In some species, both males and females have horns; in others, only males. Females that lack horns have the same statistics but lack an effective attack.  Antelopes graze in large herds, ever on the watch for predators. Even the hint of a threat can send the whole herd springing away toward safer pastures. Antelopes rarely fight except among themselves during mating season or when cornered by a predator.  The statistics presented above work well not only for numerous species of antelope, but also for smaller-sized, deerlike herbivores found throughout the world.  Of course, not all antelopes are Small. You can generate statistics for larger antelope species, such as elands or kudus, by advancing the antelope presented above by 2 Hit Dice and increasing its size category to Medium. All antelopes of this size are CR 1 creatures.   Antelope Companions  Starting Statistics: Size Small; Speed 60 ft.; AC +1 natural armor; Attack gore (1d4); Ability Scores Str 10, Dex 17, Con 14; Int 2; Wis 13; Cha 5; Special Qualities low-light vision.  4th-Level Advancement: Ability Scores Str +2, Dex +2, Con +2; Special Attacks powerful charge (gore, 2d4).
