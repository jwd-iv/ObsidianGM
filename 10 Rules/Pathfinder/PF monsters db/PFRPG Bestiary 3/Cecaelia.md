SpecialAbilities: Ink Cloud (Ex) Once per hour as a standard action, a cecaelia can emit a 10-foot-radius sphere of ink while underwater. This ink cloud provides total concealment and persists for 1 minute.  Tentacle Sense (Ex) As a swift action while swimming and while it is not grappled or grappling, the cecaelia can spread its tentacles wide to form a sensory net around it. This grants blindsight to a range of 10 feet and lasts as long as the cecaelia concentrates. While this effect lasts, the creature cannot attack with its tentacles or move.

Description: Cecaelias are intelligent human-octopus hybrids that hunt coastlines and ocean reefs. A cecaelia's humanoid upper body varies individually but generally ref lects the features of the inhabitants of the  nearest humanoid settlements. Sages think this is an adaptive trait, akin to an octopus's natural camouf lage, allowing cecaelias to mutate within one to two generations to blend in with humanoids sharing their territory. Cecaelia stand 6 feet tall on land, and weigh just over 200 pounds. They generally live to be 60 years old.  Cecaelias don't normally wear clothes, but often carry woven seaweed backpacks. They prefer not to wear armor, though when they do, they prefer light, flexible varieties. Tattoos are a common form of decoration as well.  Cecaelias are inquisitive creatures, but wary of strangers, and are quickly frustrated by wordy attempts at diplomacy-which they nearly always view as attempts at deception. As allies, they can be valuable to coastal communities since they often dig up treasures from the seabed that they then trade for fragments of polished glass or bits of "land fare," as they refer to food not taken from the sea.
