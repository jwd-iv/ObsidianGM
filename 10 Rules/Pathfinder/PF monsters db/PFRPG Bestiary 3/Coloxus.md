SpecialAbilities:
  Droning Wings (Ex): >
    Once per day, when it flutters its wings as a standard action, a coloxus can create a mesmerizing display of color and a sound-dampening buzzing drone. All creatures within 30 feet that can see the coloxus must make a DC 24 Will save or be slowed for up to 6 rounds. Each subsequent round, the coloxus must take a swift action to maintain the effect or the effect ceases at the end of its turn. Additionally, the sound creates a buffer against sonic energy, granting the fly demon immunity to sonic attacks or effects while it continues to drone. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  Siphon (Su): >
    Any creature bitten by a coloxus must make a DC 23 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Charisma damage. A coloxus heals itself of 5 points of damage for every point of Charisma damage it deals. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Description: Coloxus demons, known also as fly demons, resemble humans with the head of a fly and twin pairs of gossamer wings. Even their smallest movements and gestures seem infused with manic quickness and alertness. A coloxus prefers to wear opulent clothing and jewels that would rival the wealthiest nobility of any race. A coloxus is 6 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds.  Ironically-given their grotesque, insectile appearance-coloxus demons are demons of vanity. They are formed from the souls of narcissistic mortals responsible for disasters or tragedy through their careless self-absorption.  Despite their foul appearance, coloxus demons consider themselves cultured and elite. They are unusually patient and well mannered for demons, and as a result are often used as emissaries, diplomats, and negotiators by marilith generals, balors, and even demon lords. Even when facing hated foes, coloxus demons are the epitome of courtesy, but such manners are always a deceitful veneer, masking the creatures' efforts to gain the upper hand.  Evil mortal spellcasters are fond of conjuring coloxus demons for similar roles, but the monsters also work well as assassins. Even in this role, a coloxus is dignified and polite. Only when presented with a ref lection of itself does the normally civilized coloxus show its true demonic colors-any creature foolish enough to trick a coloxus into looking at a mirror finds herself the eternal foe of an insulted and scandalized demon.
