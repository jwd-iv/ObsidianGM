SpecialAbilities: Musk (Ex) Up to twice per day, a skunk can spray a stream of noxious musk at a single target within 10 feet as a standard action. With a successful ranged touch attack, the creature struck by this spray must make a DC 11 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds and then sickened for 1d4 minutes by the horrific stench. A successful save reduces the effect to only 1d4 rounds of being sickened. A creature cannot use the scent ability as long as it is affected by this musk. The save DC is Constitution-based, and includes a +2 racial bonus.

Description: These small mammals are well known to humanoids and forest creatures alike, with their distinctive black-and-white-striped markings and infamous scent glands. Creatures like big cats or wolves that normally would make a meal of such a small creature give skunks plenty of space, for they have learned well that the combination of black and white on a skunk's back equates to a hideously overpowering stench.
