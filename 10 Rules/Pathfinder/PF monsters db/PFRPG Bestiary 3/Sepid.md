SQ: deflect rays
SpecialAbilities: Deflect Rays (Su) Once per round as an immediate action, a sepid can use its Deflect Arrows feat to deflect a ray or a spell that uses a ranged touch attack.  Rain of Debris (Su) Three times per day as a standard action, a sepid can call forth a hail of stones, wood, metal, and similar debris. The debris rains down and pelts all creatures in a 10-foot-high, 40-foot-radius cylinder centered on the sepid, dealing 15d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 25 half ). This attack does not harm the sepid, and counts as an evil attack for the purpose of damage reduction. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Description: Warlords among the divs, sepids spread fear, slaughter, and despair wherever they pass. They foster battles, incite rebellions, and seek heroes to slay, destroying all that which gives common people hope. With their falchions in hand, sepids often stand at the fore of the foul legions they raise.  Sepids delight in twisting the truth, but while all divs are liars, sepids make themselves predictable by always doing the opposite of what they claim, and wise opponents turn this knowledge to their own advantage.  Sepids stand 13 feet tall and weigh upward of 1,500 pounds.
