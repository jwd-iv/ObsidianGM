  Tidal Wave (Su): >
    Once per day, a great wyrm sea dragon can create a tidal wave. This ability is the same as the bronze dragon's ability of the same name (Bestiary 104).
  Torrent Breath (Su): >
    Instead of a cone of super-heated steam, a very young or older sea dragon can breathe a line of pressurized water twice the length of the sea dragon's cone breath weapon. This line deals bludgeoning damage.
  Unfettered Swimmer (Su): >
    A juvenile sea dragon gains a 10-foot bonus to its swim speed. The sea dragon's swim speed continues to increase by an additional 10 feet every two age categories. Furthermore, while swimming, the sea dragon is treated as if under the effects of the spell freedom of movement.

Description: Infused with the power of waves and storms, sea dragons- or jiaolungs, as they are known in many lands-are draconic protectors of oceans and their creatures. Possessing tempestuous natures, sea dragons wander widely, sometimes claiming thousands of miles of ocean and coastlines as their protectorates.
