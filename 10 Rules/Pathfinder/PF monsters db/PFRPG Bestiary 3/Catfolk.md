Description: >
  Most catfolk are tribal hunter-gatherers who dwell in harmony with nature, though some tribes have acclimated well to urban environments. As a culture, catfolk are loyal, generous, and amiable. They like belonging to and being at harmony with a group whose members work together to accomplish their needs and wants. Tribal catfolk prefer for the most capable societal members to lead, so every tribe has a council of elevated subchiefs. A tribe's chief is usually the most competent (and magically talented) member of that tribe.  Personal growth is part of catfolk culture, as is expression as a means of personal exploration. Catfolk have few taboos, and often exhibit harmless but strange eccentricities. Individuals cultivate a wide range of pursuits and self-expression, taking risks others might label unwise. Most individual catfolk like to be the center of attention, but not at the cost of group cohesion.  CATFOLK CHARACTERS  Catfolk have no racial Hit Dice, gaining their capabilities from class levels. All catfolk have the following racial traits.  +2 Dexterity, -2 Wisdom, +2 Charisma: Catfolk are agile and amiable, but they are known for their lack of common sense and self-control.  Low-Light Vision: In dim light, catfolk can see twice as far as humans.  Cat's Luck: See above.  Sprinter: See above.  Natural Hunter: Catfolk receive a +2 racial bonus on Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks.  Languages: Catfolk speak Catfolk and Common. A catfolk who has a high Intelligence score can choose from the following bonus languages: Elven, Gnoll, Gnome, Goblin, Halfling, Orc, and Sylvan.
