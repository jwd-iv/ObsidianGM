SpecialAbilities:
  Discorporate (Ex): >
    A junk golem can break apart into its constituent pieces as a standard action, becoming a swarming mass of Tiny parts. It gains the swarm subtype, its space changes to 10 feet, and its reach changes to 0. In this form, it gains a swarm attack that deals 1d6 points of damage and inflicts disease, but loses its slam attacks. It can revert back to its normal form as a full-round action.
  Disease (Ex): >
    Tetanus: Slam-injury; save Fort DC 12; onset 1d6 days; frequency 1 day; effect 1d4 Dex damage. Each time someone takes Dexterity damage from tetanus, there's a 50% chance his jaw muscles stiffen, preventing speech and the use of spells with verbal components for 24 hours; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Immunity to Magic (Ex): >
    A junk golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against a junk golem, as noted below. • A shatter spell causes a junk golem to discorporate and dazes it for 1 round. • A grease spell affects the junk golem as if it were haste for 1d6 rounds and ends any slow effect on it. • An arcane lock or hold portal spell affects the junk golem as if it were a slow spell for 1d6 rounds and breaks any haste effect on it. • A wood shape or rusting grasp spell deals 2d6 points of damage to a junk golem.
  Junk Repair (Su): >
    A junk golem has fast healing 2 when in an area with a high concentration of debris, such as a refuse heap or the area created by another junk golem's discorporate ability.
