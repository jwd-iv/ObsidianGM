  Repair (Ex): >
    A skinstitch can repair itself by sewing additional fabric, leather, or hide to its body. Doing so requires at least 1 square foot of material and a full-round action, which restores 1 hit point to the skinstitch.

A skinstitch is a crude construct made of cloth, leather, hides, and skins sewn together into a roughly ogre-like shape and stuffed with hay. Skinstitches are usually created by a spellcaster lacking the power, talent, or gold to craft a flesh golem. A skinstitch's stuffing juts out of gaps in the sewing and the mouths and eye-holes of its component faces, giving it a horrifying, ragged look. Swarms of vermin and other creatures often find refuge within the straw, and the magic of this construct grants swarms nesting within its body amazing regenerative powers. Despite its appearance, a skinstitch is strong, tough, and agile, though its components make it susceptible to fire.  VARIANT SKINSTITCHES A skinstitch created with material from specific creatures, such as dragons or fire giants, may gain additional abilities appropriate to that creature.  Enhanced Skinstitch (CR +1): An enhanced skinstitch has a natural armor bonus 5 greater than normal, a +5 bonus on Stealth checks, and fire resistance 10.  Resilient Skinstitch (CR +1): A resilient skinstitch loses its fire vulnerability and gains fire resistance 10 and DR 5/magic. Construction  A skinstitch's body is made from leather and cloth costing at least 500 gp.
