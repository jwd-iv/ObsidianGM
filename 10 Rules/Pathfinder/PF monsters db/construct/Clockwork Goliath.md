SpecialAbilities:
  Cannon (Ex): >
    One of a goliath's arms ends in a cannon. The goliath may use this as one of its four slam attacks, or it can use it to fire cannonballs. A cannon has a range increment of 100 feet, and deals 6d6 points of bludgeoning and piercing damage on a hit with a x4 critical modifier. A clockwork goliath's cannon can hold up to 12 cannonballs-reloading a single cannonball is a standard action.
  Self-Destruction (Su): >
    When a goliath's hit points are reduced to 10% its total (21 hp for most clockwork goliaths) or less but still above 0, it self-destructs on its next turn, bursting in an explosion of metal scraps and steam that deals 12d6 points of slashing damage plus 12d6 points of fire damage to all creatures within a 20-foot-radius burst. A successful DC 24 Reflex save halves the damage. The save is Constitution-based.

Description: The thunderous clockwork goliath is easily recognized as the epitome of technology created to destroy. The exact nature of a clockwork goliath's "hands" varies-they all resolve as slam attacks in melee combat, though.  The clockwork goliath towers over most creatures and buildings; standing at a height of 45 feet, it weighs over 100 tons.  Construction  The clockwork goliath is one of the most difficult of its kind to create. The creator must start with crafted clockwork pieces worth 20,000 gp.  CLOCKWORK GOLIATH  CL 18th; Price 300,000 gp  Construction  Requirements Craft Construct, Gunsmithing (Ultimate Combat 103), animate objects, geas/quest, and limited wish, creator must be at least caster level 18th; Skill Craft (clockwork) DC 25; Cost 160,000 gp
