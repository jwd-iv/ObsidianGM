SpecialAbilities:
  Efficient Winding (Ex): >
    A clockwork soldier can function for 2 days per Hit Die every time it is wound.
  Latch (Ex): >
    Clockwork soldiers have specially designed hands that easily grasp and lock onto weapons and objects. A soldier can attempt to disarm or grapple as a standard action without provoking an attack of opportunity, and it receives a +2 bonus on disarm checks. In addition, it receives a +2 bonus to CMD against attempts to disarm it.
  Proficient (Ex): >
    A clockwork soldier is proficient with all simple and martial weapons.
  Standby (Ex): >
    A clockwork soldier can place itself on standby as a standard action. While on standby, a clockwork soldier cannot move or take any actions. It remains aware of its surroundings but takes a -4 penalty on Perception checks. Time spent on standby does not count against the soldier's wind-down duration. A clockwork soldier can exit standby as a swift action-if it does so to initiate combat, it gains a +4 racial bonus on its Initiative check.
