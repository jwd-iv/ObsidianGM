SpecialAbilities:
  Net (Ex): >
    As a standard action, a clockwork servant can launch a net from its shoulder. The launcher itself can contain up to five nets-loading a folded net into the launcher is a standard action. Some clockwork servants are outfitted with masterwork or even magic nets, although the clockwork servant presented here is armed with standard nets.
  Repair Clockwork (Ex): >
    Clockwork servants are adept at repairing other clockwork constructs. As a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity, a clockwork servant can repair damage done to either itself or an adjacent clockwork creature, healing 1d10 points of damage to the target.

Description: Since clockwork engineers can't always be present to make sure their devices are working at full capacity, the clockwork servant was invented to serve that role. Clockwork servants excel at repairing themselves and other clockworks on the battlefield, proving useful for skirmishes and campaigns alike.  Rumors of clockwork servants with magically imparted intelligence persist among explorers of certain strange ruins-while no smarter than the average human, such "awakened" clockwork servants have skills and feats as appropriate for their Hit Dice (Disable Device +7, Perception +2, and Skill Focus [Disable Device] for most intelligent clockwork servants), and are said to serve in more complex roles than mere repair workers. An intelligent clockwork has an Intelligence score of 11 and can speak one language.  Clockwork servants are about 5 feet tall and weigh over 400 pounds.  Construction  The creator of a clockwork servant must start with crafted clockwork pieces worth 500 gp.  CLOCKWORK SERVANT  CL 12th; Price 7,500 gp (13,500 for an intelligent servant)  Construction  Requirements Craft Construct, geas/quest and make whole, creator must be at least caster level 12th; Skill Craft (clockwork) DC 20; Cost 4,000 gp (7,000 for an intelligent clockwork servant)
