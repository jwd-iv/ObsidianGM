SpecialAbilities:
  Cemented Mind (Ex): >
    A soulbound shell can never change its known or prepared spells.
  Soul Focus (Su): >
    The soul bound to the shell lives within a gem inside its chest. As long as this soul focus remains intact, it can be used to animate another shell, at the same cost as creating a new soulbound shell, and retains its personality and memories. A soul focus has hardness 8, 12 hit points, and a break DC of 20.  Spells A spellbound shell casts spells as a 12th-level cleric, witch, or wizard, but does not gain any other class abilities.
  Susceptible to Mind-Affecting Effects (Ex): >
    A soulbound shell is not immune to mind-affecting effects.
