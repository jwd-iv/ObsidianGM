  Construction Points (Ex): >
    Animated objects have a number of Construction Points used to purchase abilities and defenses in addition to those presented above.
    A medium animated object has 2 CP; differently sized objects have CP totals as detailed on the size chart on this page.
    If an animated object spends more CP than its size category would allow, its CR increases by 1 (minimum of +1) for every 2 additional CP spent.
      - *Additional Attack* (1 CP): Gains an additional slam attack.
      - *Additional Movement* (1 CP): Gains a new mode of movement (burrow, climb, fly [clumsy], or swim) at a speed equal to its base speed.
      - *Constrict* (1 CP): Gains constrict with its slam attacks (the object must have grab before it can take this ability).
      - *Faster* (1 CP): One of the object's movement modes increases by +10 ft.
      - *Grab* (1 CP): Gains grab special attack with slam attacks.
      - *Metal* (2 CP): The object is made of common metal. Its hardness increases to 10, and it gains a +2 increase to its natural armor bonus.
      - *Mithral* (4 CP): The object is made of mithral. Its hardness increases to 15, and it gains a +4 increase to its natural armor bonus.
      - *Adamantine* (6 CP): The object is made of adamantine. Its hardness increases to 20, and it gains a +6 increase to its natural armor bonus.
      - *Stone* (1 CP): The object is made of stone or crystal. Its hardness increases to 8 and it gains a +1 increase to its natural armor bonus.
      - *Trample* (2 CP): The object gains the trample special attack (see page 305 for damage and save DC).
  Construction Flaws (Ex): >
    Animated objects can gain more CP by applying flaws, which hamper the object but provide additional CP to spend on beneficial abilities. If the CP gained in this way is not spent on beneficial abilities, its CR decreases by 1 for every 2 CP conserved.
      - *Brittle* (+1 CP): The object gains vulnerability to cold.
      - *Cloth* (+1 CP): The object is made of thick cloth. Its hardness decreases to 0.
      - *Clunky* (+1 CP): Treat the object as though it had the staggered special quality.
      - *Flammable* (+1 CP): The object gains vulnerability fire.
      - *Haunted* (+1 CP): The object is haunted by a malevolent spirit. It takes damage from positive energy as if it were an undead creature and can be detect by detect undead.
      - *Slower* (+1 CP): One of the objectâ€™s movement modes decreases by - 10 ft.

An animated object is not simply one monster, but a whole category.
  The stats presented here are for a Medium animated object (with 2 CP that have not been spent to gain additional abilities), but any object can become animated, most commonly via the spell animate objects.
  Permanent animated objects can be built using the Craft Construct feat (see page 314).
  
  Unless an animated object uses a Construction Point to be made of another material, all animated objects are made of wood or material of equivalent hardness.
  Creating an animated object of a different size than Medium can be done simply by adjusting the object's size (and thus adjusting its Strength, Dexterity, natural armor bonus, and size modifier to attack and AC as detailed on page 296) and Hit Dice.
