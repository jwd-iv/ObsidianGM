Description: >
  Originating from the Shadow Plane, wayangs are pixie-like in stature with extremely gangly limbs and skin the color of deep shadow. They follow a philosophy known as "The Dissolution," which teaches that in passing they again merge into shadow.  WAYANG CHARACTERS  Wayangs are defined by class levels-they don't have racial Hit Dice. Wayangs have the following racial traits.  +2 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence, -2 Wisdom: Wayangs are nimble and cagey, but their worldview is strange.  Small: Wayangs are Small creatures and gain a +1 size bonus to AC, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, a -1 penalty on combat maneuver checks and to CMD, and a +4 size bonus on Stealth checks.  Slow Speed: Wayangs have a base speed of 20 feet.  Darkvision: Wayangs can see in the dark up to 60 feet.  Light and Dark (Su): See stat block above.  Lurker: Wayangs gain a +2 racial bonus on Perception and Stealth checks.  Shadow Magic: Wayangs add +1 to the save DC of shadow subschool spells they cast. Wayangs with a Charisma score of 11 or higher gain the following spell-like abilities: 1/ day-ghost sound, pass without trace, ventriloquism (caster level equals the wayang's level, saves are Charisma-based).  Shadow Resistance: Wayangs get a +2 racial bonus on saves against spells of the shadow subschool.  Languages: Wayangs begin play speaking Common and Wayang. Those with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following: any human language, Abyssal, Aklo, Draconic, Goblin, and Infernal.
