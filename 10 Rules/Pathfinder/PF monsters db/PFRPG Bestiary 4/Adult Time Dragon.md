SpecialAbilities:
  Immortal (Ex): >
    Time dragons age, but don't die from old age.
  Read the Threads (Su): >
    A time dragon gains a racial bonus on initiative checks equal to its age category. In addition, a time dragon is immune to the staggered condition.
  Alien Presence (Su): >
    A creature that fails its saving throw against a time dragon's alien presence is staggered for 5d6 rounds (or stunned if it has 4 Hit Dice or fewer).
  Shifting Breath (Su): >
    Instead of a cone of electricity, an old or older time dragon can use its breath weapon to displace creatures in time. Each creature in the cone must succeed at a Will save or be shifted forward in time a number of rounds equal to 1/2 the dragon's age category (DC equal to breath weapon). For an affected creature, it's as if no time passed. Creatures that succeed at their saves are staggered for 1 round.
  Second Chance (Su): >
    Three times per day as an immediate action, an ancient or older time dragon can force a creature (including itself) to reroll any d20 roll. The target must use the result of the second roll.
  Time Travel (Su): >
    Up to three times in its life, a great wyrm time dragon can travel to any point in time, taking with it a number of willing creatures equal to its Charisma modifier.
