Description: Mammoth fleas are fierce predators. They require vast amounts of blood to survive, though once full, they can survive for months before needing to feed again. For this reason, they seek larger prey like cows and horses, and plague agrarian communities that raise herd animals. A mammoth flea's bite is excruciatingly painful, and leaves behind a raised, ring-shaped scar.
