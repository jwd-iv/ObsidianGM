SpecialAbilities: Tail Lash (Ex) The diplodocus prefers to attack with its tail. The dinosaur can snap its incredibly long tail with surprising speed like an enormous whip-this is a primary attack that deals bludgeoning and slashing damage. A diplodocus can make two separate attacks with its tail lash as a full-attack action.
