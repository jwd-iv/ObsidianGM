SpecialAbilities:
  Blow Smoke (Su): >
    Smoke constantly drifts from a kapre's mouth, and as a standard action it can exhale a 30-foot cone of smoke. Any creature in the area must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. This is a poison effect, and the save DC is Constitution-based.
  Confounding Aura (Su): >
    A magical aura surrounds a kapre, confusing and distracting its foes. Within a kapre's aura, the DC of all Survival checks is increased by 15, and creatures trained in Survival are no longer able to automatically determine true north. On top of this, any creature within a kapre's aura must succeed at a DC 21 Will saving throw when it enters the area or take a -4 penalty on concentration checks, initiative checks, and skill checks. A kapre can suppress this aura at will.
  Tree Meld (Su): >
    A kapre can meld with any tree, similar to how the spell meld with stone functions. It can remain melded with a tree as long as it wishes.

Description: Vehement defenders of the unusual locations of the natural world, kapres have a complicated relationship with the "civilized" races. Formed of dense tree matter, they are as much part of the forest as their botanical brethren. Their intimidating physical size, territorial nature, and unusual approach to friendship often bring them into conf lict with local tribes and aggressive explorers. With slender limbs and thick, gnarled torsos, kapres are awkwardly humanoid in appearance, and if not for the soft glow of their eyes they could be mistaken for treants. Exceedingly secretive and wary, kapres prefer to avoid conf lict, using their imposing size and confounding auras to intimidate any would-be invaders. Leaning out of huge trees, they blow smoke onto lost explorers, persuading them to flee.
