SpecialAbilities: Cloying Scent (Su) Qallupilluks exude a vaguely sweet and unexpectedly pleasant briny scent. This smell comforts and distracts humanoids and animals that come within 15 feet of the qallupilluk, causing such creatures to take a -2 penalty on saves against mind-affecting effects.  Curse of Scales (Su) If a qallupilluk grapples a Medium or Small humanoid opponent, her target begins transforming into an aquatic monster. Starting on the third consecutive round of grappling, the grappled target must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save every round or fully transform into a grindylow (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 148), reefclaw (Bestiary 2 234), bunyip (Bestiary 2 50), merrow (Bestiary 2 189), or scrag (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 268). Once fully transformed, the creature is slavishly devoted to the qallupilluk that created it. If the qallupilluk is slain, the creature loses this devotion but remains transformed. The transformation ends after 1 hour or if the creature is slain. A qallupilluk can make this transformation permanent by performing a ritual that takes 10 minutes and deals 30 points of damage to the qallupilluk. This is a curse and polymorph effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Description: A qallupilluk is a sinister and much-dreaded haglike denizen of cold seas. An ambush predator, she waits near gaps and weak points in the ice and listens for the footsteps of creatures above, sometimes humming or tapping on the ice like a trapped seal in the hope of drawing the curious within range of her alluring scent. When one grabs a victim, she either drowns her prey, saving the body to eat later, or transforms her prey into a monstrous servant that she treats as her own child-and eventually, as a mate. All qallupilluks are female, but they can reproduce with other aquatic monsters. Their offspring are always qallupilluks. Qallupilluks may craft hovels or lodges from stone or coral on the seabed. A few craft semipermanent homes in the submerged recesses of icebergs. They often know fragments of ancient and obscure natural secrets.
