Description: >
  These creatures are the result of magical draconic experiments at crossbreeding wyverns and kobolds. Wyvarans are fiercely territorial creatures loyal to their kin and tribe, and allow no interlopers into their lands without good reason or proper tribute. Each defends its personal property, and seeks revenge on any who dare steal from it. Most evil and neutral wyvarans primarily concern themselves with expanding their territory and wealth. Many civilized races dismiss wyvarans as fast, dumb, selfish brutes. However, a creature who respects the wyvarans' rules about their property finds that they make steadfast and loyal allies. Adventuring wyvarans often view their companions as clutchmates, and are willing to take great risks to protect them.  WYVARAN CHARACTERS Wyvarans are defined by their class levels-they don't have racial Hit Dice. All wyvarans have the following racial traits.  +2 Dexterity, -2 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom: Wyvarans have a reptilian grace and a strong will, but they tend to be a little dimwitted.  Normal Speed: Wyvarans have a base speed of 30 feet.  Flight: Wyvarans have dragonlike wings that grant them a fly speed of 30 feet with clumsy maneuverability.  Slapping Tail (Ex): Wyvarans have a tail attack they can only use when making attacks of opportunity. This slapping tail attack deals 1d8 points of damage plus the wyvaran's Strength modifier.  Darkvision 60 ft.: Wyvarans can see in the dark up to 60 feet.  Low-Light Vision: Wyvarans have low-light vision.  Languages: Wyvarans speak Common and Draconic. A wyvaran with a high Intelligence score can choose from the following: Dwarven, Elven, Gnome, Goblin, and Orc.
