Description: Rukhs are foul-tempered creatures related to rocs, except they resemble two-headed vultures instead of raptors. They hunt live prey and carrion, typically gliding high above the desert in search of things to eat. They avoid creatures of their size or larger, preferring easier prey-horses, camels, and humanoids for adult rukhs, or Medium and Small creatures for juveniles. They nest on mountains and in cliffside caves, as they are too large to roost in trees. Few young rukhs reach adulthood, as many tribes and caravans hunt them for meat, often using a lone, weak-looking scout to lure a hungry juvenile into striking distance for an ambush. A typical adult rukh stands nearly 35 feet tall and has a wingspan of more than 60 feet. Most are scrawny due to hunger. Coupled with their lightweight bones for easier flying, they rarely top 800 pounds. Juvenile rukhs usually stand about 10 feet tall, with a relatively small wingspan of nearly 18 feet, and weigh about 200 pounds.
