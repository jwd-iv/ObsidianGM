Description: >
  Born of mysterious origins and raised by unknowing foster parents, changelings are the children of hags and their tricked lovers. Most don't know of their monstrous origins, but there comes a time in every changeling's life when these roots begin to call out to their host, urging the confused girl toward some end she can't identify. When a hag of any sort conceives a child with a man, the result is a changeling. The male parent is usually killed and eaten by his partner before he can see the offspring. Changelings are, without exception, female, and almost always tall and slender. A changeling's hair is typically long and dark, and her skin abnormally pale, but she otherwise looks for all practical purposes like a member of her father's race. A frequent-but not universal-trait of changelings is noticeably mismatched eyes, each of which is a different color common among her father's race. Upon reaching puberty and adulthood, the average changeling born to a human father stands approximately 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 110 pounds.  CHANGELING CHARACTERS  Changelings are defined by their class levels- they don't have racial Hit Dice. All changelings have the following racial traits.  -2 Constitution, +2 Wisdom, +2 Charisma: Changelings are frail, but are clever and comely.  Hag Trait: A changeling possesses one of the following traits, depending on the type of hag her mother is.  Hulking Changeling (Annis Hag): The changeling gains a +1 racial bonus on melee damage rolls.  Green Widow (Green Hag): The changeling gains a +2 racial bonus on Bluff checks against creatures that are sexually attracted to her.  Sea Lungs (Sea Hag): The changeling can hold her breath for a number of rounds equal to 3 x her Constitution score before she risks drowning.  Claws: A changeling's hands and fingernails tend to harden and become sharp, granting her two claw attacks, each of which deals 1d4 points of damage.  Natural Armor: Changelings have a +1 natural armor bonus.  Darkvision: Changelings can see in the dark up to 60 feet.  Languages: Changelings begin play speaking Common and the primary language of their host society. Changelings who have high Intelligence scores can choose from the following: Aklo, Draconic, Dwarven, Elven, Giant, Gnoll, Goblin, and Orc.
