SQ: agile, no breath, starflight
SpecialAbilities:
  Agile (Ex): >
    Void dragons have good aerial maneuverability regardless of their age or size.
  Alien Presence (Su): >
    A void dragon's alien presence causes an opponent that fails its save to be overcome with dizziness, becoming sickened (or nauseated if the target has 4 or fewer Hit Dice) for 5d6 rounds.
  Obliterate (Su): >
    A young or older void dragon's bite deals an additional 2d6 points of negative energy damage. A creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by this attack must succeed at a Fortitude save or be immediately slain and reduced to ashes (as the disintegrate spell). The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Suffocating Breath (Su): >
    Instead of dealing cold damage, a very young or older void dragon can breathe a cone-shaped suffocation effect. An air-dependent creature that fails its Fortitude save suffocates (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 445) for a number of rounds equal to the dragon's age category. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  Void Gaze (Su): >
    A creature within 30 feet of an adult or older void dragon must succeed at a Will save or become confused for 1d6 rounds. This gaze attack is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
