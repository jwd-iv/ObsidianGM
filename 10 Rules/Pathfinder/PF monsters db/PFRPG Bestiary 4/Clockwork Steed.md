Description: These tireless constructs were designed by engineers as a replacement for normal horses. They can gallop ceaselessly for hours or even days if required. In addition to their endurance, clockwork steeds pack a powerful physical punch-blows from their hooves can send smaller creatures flying. Though many riders enjoy the unquestioning way that clockwork steeds accept commands from their riders, others find these steeds' lack of personality frustrating. Unlike normal horses, a clockwork steed lacks the ability to create a bond with its rider.  CLOCKWORK CHARGER  Clockwork chargers are constructed to wreak greater mechanized terror on the battlefield. A clockwork charger has the advanced simple template and is specially equipped for enhancing mounted charges or making such charges even without a rider by way of its pivoted lance. A clockwork charger has a pivoted latch large enough to support a lance and allows even those who are not proficient with a lance to use it as if they were. Furthermore, the clockwork charger is proficient with any lance equipped in the pivot and gains the undersized weapon special ability.  Construction  The creator of a clockwork steed must start with crafted clockwork pieces worth 3,000 gp. When building a clockwork charger, the pivot can be built for any size lance, typically Medium.
