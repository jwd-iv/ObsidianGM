Description: >
  The nagaji are a race of ophidian humanoids created by true nagas to serve as slaves. Vaguely humanlike in appearance, with scaled skin that mimics the colors and patterns of various true nagas, nagaji have forked tongues and lidless eyes, giving them an unblinking gaze that most other races find unnerving. Nagaji venerate nagas as their creators, even going so far as to deify them. Despite the inf luence of their creators, nagaji maintain their own distinct cultures containing elements borrowed from those of both nagas and humans. They prefer warm to tropical regions and settle in wild, isolated regions such as steaming jungles, vast swamps, or volcanic mountains where they erect large temples in honor of their naga creators. These magnificent temples are surrounded by dozens of simple mud daub huts and clay brick structures, which serve as the nagaji's homes and public buildings. Nagaji typically stand between 5-1/2 and 6 feet tall and weigh about 175 pounds.  NAGAJI CHARACTERS  Nagaji are defined by class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. Nagaji have the following racial traits.  +2 Strength, +2 Charisma, -2 Intelligence: Nagaji have strong bodies and personalities, but disdain intellectualism.  Medium: Nagaji are Medium creatures and have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.  Normal Speed: Nagaji have a base speed of 30 feet.  Low-Light Vision: Nagaji can see twice as far as humans in conditions of dim light.  Armored Scales: Nagaji have a +1 natural armor bonus due to their scaly flesh.  Resistant (Ex): Nagaji receive a +2 racial saving throw bonus against mind-affecting effects and poison.  Serpent's Sense (Ex): Nagaji receive a +2 racial bonus on Handle Animal checks against reptiles, and a +2 racial bonus on Perception checks.  Languages: Nagaji begin play speaking Common and Draconic. Nagaji with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following: any human language, Abyssal, Aklo, Celestial, Draconic, Giant, Infernal, and Sylvan.
