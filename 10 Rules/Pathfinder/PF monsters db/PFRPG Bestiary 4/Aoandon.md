  Touch of Madness (Su): >
    The touch of an aoandon causes maddening fear. As a standard action it can make an incorporeal touch attack that deals 10d6 damage. Any living creature damaged by an aoandon's touch attack must succeed at a DC 24 Will save or be confused for 1d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds at this saving throw can't be confused again by this aoandon's touch of madness for 10 minutes. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Description: An aoandon is an incorporeal outsider formed from the spirit of a woman who died pursuing some ill-fated relationship. An aoandon waits for her chance to seek revenge on those who wronged her in her mortal life. If that person is dead, she finds a surrogate-someone who reminds her of the wrongdoer-and acts out her delusions with unrelenting vindictiveness. These spirits can also appear as a result of mishaps with calling spells, but such instances are rare.  CALLING AN AOANDON  Calling an aoandon requires a paper lantern inscribed with runes and fueled by oils costing no less than 5,000 gp. Three or more creatures must chant the creature's name for 1 minute, then extinguish the lantern. There's a 1% chance per Hit Die the callers collectively possess that the aoandon is called. Relatives of the aoandon count as triple their normal Hit Dice. The aoandon isn't under the control of its conjurers, and can return to where she came from only after she has murdered at least one person she feels is responsible for her anguish.
