Description: >
  Samsarans are a race of humanoids whose spirits naturally reincarnate into another samsaran upon death. They have dark hair, pale bluish skin, and eyes with no visible pupil or iris. A samsaran's blood is clear like water. Each samsaran is born with the knowledge that it has lived before, and shall continue onward after death through the cycle of reincarnation. When a samsaran dies, its body fades from sight, and another samsaran child appears somewhere and matures at the normal rate. Samsarans can reproduce with humans and produce true human offspring. Typical samsarans pursue simple, ascetic lives apart from mainstream society. They live in small isolated farming communities as individuals or couples, with older samsarans adopting newly manifested children. Some work as consultants, mediators, prophets, or seers.  SAMSARAN CHARACTERS  Samsarans are defined by class levels-they do not have racial Hit Dice. Samsarans have the following racial traits.  +2 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom, -2 Constitution: Samsarans are insightful and strong-minded, but their bodies tend to be frail.  Medium: Samsarans are Medium creatures and have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.  Normal Speed: Samsarans have a base speed of 30 feet.  Low-Light Vision (Ex): Samsarans can see twice as far as humans in conditions of dim light.  Lifebound (Ex): Samsarans gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against death effects, negative energy effects, saves to remove negative levels, and Con checks to stabilize.  Spell-Like Abilities (Sp): Samsarans with a Charisma score of 11 or higher gain the following: 1/day-comprehend languages, deathwatch, stabilize. The caster level is equal to the samsaran's character level.  Shards of the Past (Ex): A samsaran gains a +2 bonus on any two skills and these become class skills.  Languages: Samsarans begin play speaking Common and Samsaran. Those with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following: any human language, Abyssal, Aquan, Auran, Celestial, Draconic, Giant, Ignan, Infernal, and Terran.
