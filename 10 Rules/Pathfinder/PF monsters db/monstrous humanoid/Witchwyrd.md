SpecialAbilities:
  Absorb Force (Su): >
    Once per round, a witchwyrd can use a free hand to "catch" a magic missile fired at it. This absorbs the missile and manifests as a glowing nimbus around that hand (which is no longer considered free). The energy lasts 6 rounds or until it is used to create a force bolt. To use this ability, the witchwyrd must be aware of the incoming magic missile and cannot be flat-footed.
  Force Bolt (Su): >
    A witchwyrd can "throw" a magic missile (1d4+1 damage) from each free hand as a free action (maximum of two per round). If it has absorbed a magic missile, it can throw an additional force bolt that round, expending the absorbed energy (maximum of two additional bolts per round).

Description: Alien merchants that travel between planets and planes, witchwyrds stand 7 feet tall, weigh 300 pounds, and are covered in hairless blue-gray skin. Witchwyrds new to a market or eager to avoid identification during an important business deal fold their second sets of flexible arms behind their backs and dress in robes, the better to pass as a lessinfamous humanoid race. Witchwyrds tend to prefer the driest, warmest regions of the areas they visit-perhaps an indicator of their mysterious home world.
