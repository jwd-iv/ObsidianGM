Description: >
  Ghouls keep ghoul hounds much as humans keep hunting dogs-some ghouls view these vicious beasts as little more than tools, while more sentimental ghouls treat them as favored pets. Ghoul hounds obediently follow their ghoul masters.  Grathkoll (CR 2): A larger breed of ghoul hound, the grathkoll can be ridden by a Medium creature. A grathkoll is a ghoul hound with the giant simple template and a +10 bonus to its base land speed.
