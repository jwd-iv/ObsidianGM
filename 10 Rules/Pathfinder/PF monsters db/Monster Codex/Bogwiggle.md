SpecialAbilities: Sticky Tongue (Ex) A creature hit by a bogwiggle's tongue attack can't move more than 10 feet away from the bogwiggle and takes a -2 penalty to AC as long as the tongue is attached (this penalty does not stack if multiple tongues are attached). The tongue can be removed by succeeding at an opposed Strength check as a standard action or by dealing 2 points of slashing damage to the tongue (AC 11, damage doesn't deplete the bogwiggle's actual hit points). The bogwiggle can't move more than 10 feet away from the target while attached. It can release its tongue's grip as a free action. Like a boggard, a bogwiggle can't pull targets toward it with its tongue.  Swamp Stride (Ex) A bogwiggle can move through any sort of natural difficult terrain at its normal speed while within a swamp. Magically altered terrain affects a bogwiggle normally.

Description: Also known as toad-hounds, bogwiggles are the stunted, degenerate spawn of boggard priest-kings-these are the young who survived their meals of poisonous dragonf lies, but failed to develop properly. They appear to be dog-sized tadpoles that have stopped halfway through the transformation to full-f ledged frogs. A single set of long legs sprouts from a bogwiggle's bulbous body, and a frilled, whiplike tail protrudes from its back. Barely more intelligent than ordinary dogs, bogwiggles spend the majority of their short, violent lives serving as hunting companions and guard animals for their capricious, toadlike masters.  Bogwiggles can live up to 20 years, but because of swamp predators and the cruelty of their masters, most die long before reaching the age of 10. Bogwiggles always have the same skin tone as the boggards with which they live-typically gray, green, or black. Just as with boggards, bogwiggles lose their coloring as they age, and particularly old bogwiggles are often pale gray or almost white. The average bogwiggle is just under 3-1/2 feet long, not counting the tail-which itself is around 6 feet long. Most bogwiggles weigh roughly 65 pounds, but larger specimens have been reported by adventurers and scholars.  Despite being mistreated by their boggard masters, bogwiggles have a curiously strong affinity for them, and are intensely loyal to their tribes. Some scholars theorize that this fealty is a primitive version of a boggard's natural tribalism or religious inclinations, yet other observers have suggested that bogwiggles believe themselves capable of transformation into full boggards through unwavering devotion to their boggard superiors.
