Description: >
  According to some fey ballads, gathlains were one of the first peoples awakened in the primal world of fey. They were created from the seeds of an enormous magical tree, with the tree's mistletoe grown into their flesh forming their strange wings. Mischievous and capricious, these creatures have discordant temperaments. They act purely to entertain themselves and sate their immense curiosity about the world around them. That very curiosity has caused many to migrate to the Material Plane and adventure there. These gathlains seek out and attempt to mingle with gnomes. However, gnomes often find gathlains too undisciplined, random, and foolish for their tastes.  GATHLAIN CHARACTERS  Gathlains are defined by their class levels-they don't have racial Hit Dice. All gathlains have the following racial traits.  +2 Dexterity, -2 Constitution, +2 Charisma: Gathlains are quick, with dynamic and engaging personalities, but are rather fragile.  Small: Gathlains are Small and gain a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, a -1 penalty on combat maneuver checks and to CMD, a +2 bonus on Fly checks, and a +4 size bonus on Stealth checks.  Normal Speed: Gathlains have a base speed of 30 feet and a fly speed of 40 feet (poor).  Low-Light Vision: Gathlains can see twice as far as humans in dim light.  Natural Armor: Gathlains have a +1 natural armor bonus.  Spell-Like Abilities: 1/day-entangle, feather stepAPG (caster level equals the gathlain's character level).  Languages: Gathlains speak Common and Sylvan. A gathlain with a high Intelligence score can choose from the following languages: Draconic, Elven, Goblin, Half ling, and Orc.
