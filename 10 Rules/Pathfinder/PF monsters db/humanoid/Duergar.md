Description: >
  Cousins to dwarves, duergar are foul-tempered creatures that loathe intruders to their underground realms-but not nearly as much as they do their kinfolk closer to the surface. Duergar dwell in communities deep underground, and appear as darker, more twisted versions of their kinder kin. Their skin is a dull gray, as though rubbed with dust or ash, but this is a natural coloration that better allows them to blend with their underground surroundings. They are a race of slavers, but while non-dwarven prisoners are usually put to backbreaking work, dwarven prisoners are generally slain on the spot. In combat, duergar fire crossbows from a distance, then shift to the warhammer after a few rounds. If outnumbered, or given sufficient threat (and space), a duergar will use its enlarge person ability and begin lashing out at its enemies. Duergar Characters Duergar are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. All duergar have the following racial traits. +2 Constitution, +2 Wisdom, -4 Charisma: Duergar are hearty and observant, but also stubborn and belligerent. Slow and Steady: Duergar have a base speed of 20 feet, but their speed is never modified by armor or encumbrance. Darkvision: Duergar can see in the dark up to 120 feet. Duergar Immunities: Duergar are immune to paralysis, phantasms, and poison. They also gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities. Stability: Duergar receive a +4 racial bonus to their CMD against bull rush or trip attempts while on solid ground. Spell-Like Abilities: Duergar can cast enlarge person and invisibility each once per day, using their character level as their caster level. Both of these spell-like abilities affect the duergar only. Light Sensitivity: Duergar are dazzled as long as they remain in an area of bright light. Languages: Duergar begin play speaking Common, Dwarven, and Undercommon. Duergar with high Intelligence can choose bonus languages from the following: Aklo, Draconic, Giant, Goblin, Orc, Terran.
