Description: Half-elves stand taller than humans but shorter than elves. They
  inherit the lean build and comely features of their elven lineage, but their
  skin color is dictated by their human side. While half-elves retain the
  pointed ears of elves, theirs are more rounded and less pronounced. A
  half-elf's human-like eyes tend to range a spectrum of exotic colors running
  from amber or violet to emerald green and deep blue.
