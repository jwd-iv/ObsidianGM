Svirfneblin, or "deep gnomes," are a reclusive offshoot of the gnome race. They dwell underground in hidden cities, safe from dark elves and other subterranean races. They have skin the color of gray or brown stone. Males are bald, and females have stringy gray hair. A svirfneblin's ties to the eerie realm of the fey are much stronger than those of their surface-dwelling gnome kin, and this makes them either strangely detached from their emotions or violently random in their outbursts. Svirfneblin have long fought wars against the duergar, and have a difficult time seeing the difference between duergar and other dwarves. Svirfneblin Characters Svirfneblin are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. A svirfneblin's CR is equal to his class level. Svirfneblin have the following racial traits. -2 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +2 Wisdom, -4 Charisma: Svirfneblin are fast and observant, but relatively weak and emotionally distant. Small: Svirfneblin are Small creatures and gain a +1 size bonus to their AC, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, a -1 penalty to their CMB and CMD, and a +4 size bonus on Stealth checks. Defensive Training: Svirfneblin gain a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class. Senses: Svirfneblin have darkvision 120 ft. and lowlight vision. Fortunate: Svirfneblin gain a +2 racial bonus on all saving throws. Skilled: Svirfneblin gain a +2 racial bonus on Stealth checks; this improves to a +4 bonus underground. They gain a +2 racial bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks and Perception checks. Hatred: Svirfneblin receive a +1 bonus on attack rolls against humanoid creatures of the reptilian and dwarven subtypes due to training against these hated foes. Stonecunning: Svirfneblin gain stonecunning as a dwarf (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 21). Spell Resistance: Svirfneblin have SR equal to 11 + class levels. Svirfneblin Magic: Svirfneblin add +1 to the DC of any illusion spells they cast. Svirfneblin also gain the spell-like abilities listed above; caster level equals the svirfneblin's class levels. Languages: Svirfneblin begin play speaking Gnome and Undercommon. Those with high Int scores can choose from the following bonus languages: Aklo, Common, Draconic, Dwarven, Elven, Giant, Goblin, Orc, or Terran.
