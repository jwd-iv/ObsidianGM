Dwarves are a short and stocky race, and stand about a foot shorter
  than most humans, with wide, compact bodies that account for their burly
  appearance. Male and female dwarves pride themselves on the long length of
  their hair, and men often decorate their beards with a variety of clasps and
  intricate braids. Clean-shavenness on a male dwarf is a sure sign of madness,
  or worse-no one familiar with their race trusts a beardless dwarven man.
