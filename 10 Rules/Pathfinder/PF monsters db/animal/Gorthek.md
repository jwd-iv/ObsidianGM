Description: >
  The gorthek is, without a doubt, one of the crankiest beasts found roaming in the wilderness. Appearing as a strange combination of primeval bison and ornery rhinoceros, but with a leonine head crowned with ramlike horns, a gorthek is both immensely powerful and preternaturally hard to injure. Its thick, battering-ram head and powerful body make it a fearsome opponent, particularly when it's riled up and in full charge.  Gortheks tend to travel in small herds, grazing across remote temperate grasslands or sparsely wooded hills. When a gorthek perceives a threat-which to the gorthek includes just about everything, often even other gortheks-it launches itself into a full charge, intent on sending the enemy flying.  Orc tribes have made a practice of raising the beasts from infancy to serve as living siege engines during warfare. Future gorthek riders bond with the creatures from a very young age, and if possible use gorthek masks to make that bond stronger. When riding into battle, one orc sits astride the gorthek in a specially crafted saddle secured behind its massive horns and guides the beast using spiked reins.  An adult male gorthek stands about 7 feet high at the shoulder and weighs around 9,000 pounds.  Gorthek Companions  An orc who takes the Beast Rider feat (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Race Guide 56) can choose a gorthek as an animal companion or mount.
