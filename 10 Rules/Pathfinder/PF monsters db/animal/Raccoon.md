Brief: Presented on these pages are base animal statistics for six additional familiars beyond those most commonly used by spellcasters-of course, these statistics can also be used for normal animals as well. These familiars utilize all the standard rules for familiars presented on pages 82-83 of the Core Rulebook. Tiny or smaller familiars in this section use Dexterity to modify Climb and Swim skill checks.
