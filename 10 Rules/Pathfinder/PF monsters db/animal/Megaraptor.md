## Lore

Characters with ranks in Knowledge (nature) can learn more about dinosaurs. When a character makes a successful skill check, the following lore is revealed, including the information from lower DCs.

| 1-14     | It's a big lizard, that's probably going to try and eat you.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 15-19    | This huge predator is a megaraptor, close relative of the deinonychus and an ancient reptilian beast of the group known as dinosaurs. This result reveals all animal traits.                                                                             |
| 20-24    | Like deinonychus, these creatures are very fast for reptiles, and this speed combined with their razor sharp talons, nasty bite and ability to leap in to combat to deliver a deadly initial attack make them a very dangerous opponent.                 |
| 25+      | Perhaps even more worrying than the megaraptorâ€™s array of natural weaponry is its intelligence. Most dinosaurs are quite simple minded creatures, but these reptiles have large and advanced animal brains and often hunt in packs with cunning tactics. |
