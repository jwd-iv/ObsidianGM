The brontosaurus is one of the largest of all dinosaurs. It has a strong, tapering tail and a massive body that supports a long neck and small head. The creature is 65-75 feet long and weighs more than 30 tons. A brontosaurus is so heavy that it needs to spend most of its time in water, so that the water helps support its weight. This dinosaur eats plants, and can only be found in deep marshes or on the edges of swamps.^[Cook, D. and Moldvay, T. 1980. _The Isle of Dread._ Random House, Inc.]
