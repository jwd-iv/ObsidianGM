While not technically a dinosaur, the plesiosaurus is often found in waterways and swamps where dinosaurs and other megafauna are common. Long-necked and swift, these ambush predators prefer to dart in, bite a foe, and then swim away to hide while they wait for their victim to bleed out before swimming back to feed.

Numerous species of this creature exist, from marsh-dwelling varieties to creatures that spend their entire lives at sea.

A plesiosaurus measures 11 feet long, though nearly half of this length is neck, and weighs 1,000 pounds.
