SpecialAbilities:
  Capsize (Ex): >
    A whale can attempt to capsize a boat or ship by ramming it as a charge attack and making a CMB check.  The DC of this check is 25, or the result of the captain's Profession (sail0r) check, whichever is higher. For each size category the ship is larger than the whale's size, the whale takes a cumulative -10 penalty on this CMB check.

Whales are frequently hunted for their meat and the valuable oil in their blubber. Baleen whales have no teeth and attack with a tail slap; toothed whales like sperm whales instead attack with a bite. Whale companions are smaller species- rules for such companions are the same as those for orcas (see page 88 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary.)
