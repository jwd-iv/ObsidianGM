Description: >
  The styracosaurus is a bulky dinosaur with a solid frame and a very distinctive skull-a horned frill extends back from its head, protecting its neck and serving as a highly effective natural weapon that allows it to make attacks of opportunity. It is notorious for its ill temper, savagely attacking any creature that it perceives as a threat or even as an irritant. A styracosaurus is 18 feet long and weighs nearly 3 tons.
