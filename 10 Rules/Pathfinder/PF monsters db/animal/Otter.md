Brief: Presented on these pages are base animal statistics for six additional familiars beyond those most commonly used by spellcasters-of course, these statistics can also be used for normal animals as well. These familiars utilize all the standard rules for familiars presented on pages 82-83 of the Core Rulebook. Tiny or smaller familiars in this section use Dexterity to modify Climb and Swim skill checks.

Otters are curious and playful, and enjoy investigating new objects, sliding down wet rocks, and other simple games.
