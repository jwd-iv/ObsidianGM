### Desert

A desert is any sort of terrain that receives very little rainfall. It can be warm, temperate, or cold.

This section pertains mostly to warm and temperate deserts. In cold environments, a desert is usually tundra, which acts like another terrain category depending on the current season. During most of the year, a cold desert is covered in a layer of permafrost, creating hard, [stable](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stable) terrain (which is treated as plains). During the warm season, the permafrost thaws and turns the area into mud (which is treated as marsh).

| Obstacles |
|---|
| sand dunes |
| sinkholes |
| rubble |
| sandstorms |
| numerous ravines |
| seasonal rains might cause [[flash flood hazard]]s, sweeping away or drowning any creature in their path. [Survival](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival) checks to avoid getting lost or to become un-lost in this hex gain a +1 bonus. [Survival](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival) checks to get along in the wild increase by 5. Treat a flash flood as an avalanche, except instead of suffocating from being buried under rock, creatures who are buried must hold their breath or start drowning. |

| Ruins half-buried in the desert could still contain lost treasures or might already be looted. In either case, the ruins can be used as a place to take shelter from storms or as a lair for monsters. PCs who take shelter in these ruins suffer no effect from storms and similar hazards, but the chance of random encounters increases by 25%. |
