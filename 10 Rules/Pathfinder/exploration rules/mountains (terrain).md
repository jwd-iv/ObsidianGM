# mountains

Mountains form long barriers across the landscape that greatly impede the movement of travelers.

*Difficult*:: All [Climb](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/climb) DCs in a difficult mountain hex increase by 2. For the purposes of travel and exploration times, treat the partyâ€™s speed as one category slower on **Table: Travel Time (1 hex)** and **Table: Exploration Time (1 hex)**.

*Feature*:: The mountain is the highest in the vicinity or has an unusual shape, perhaps resembling a face or creature. Alternatively, use a feature from the Feature section of the hill hex terrain type.

*Hunting Ground*:: Bandits and monsters frequent these hexes, falling upon weary travelers. The chance of random encounters increases by 10%.

*Resource*:: The hex contains resources such as quality stone, coal, precious metals, or gems.

*Secret*:: Hidden pathways carved through the mountains offer speedier paths. If the PCs succeed at a DC 20 [Perception](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception) check to find the pathways, they can ignore the default travel time increase for the mountain hex.
