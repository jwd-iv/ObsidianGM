# forest terrain

A normal forest hex can be any sort of common forest: sparse patches of trees in the lowlands, thickly needled pines of the taiga, a lush tropical jungle, or even an ancient fruit tree grove turned overgrown and wild.

*Difficult*:: A difficult forest is a treacherous place, full of rotting trees that can fall without warning, twisted [scythe trees](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/plants/scythe-tree) that lunge at their victims, or witch-lights that lead expeditions off the path. For each hour spent traveling through a difficult forest, there is a 5% chance of a falling tree hazard. [Survival](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival) check DCs to avoid getting lost increase by 5.

*Feature*:: A forest hex feature could be either a cluster of massive old-growth trees or some type of tree that is unique to that region. In an old-growth forest, the canopy limits how much light reaches the ground, so undergrowth tends to be low-lying, tough plants like mosses and ferns.

*Hunting Ground*:: This kind of forest hex is often treated with awe by local people, as hunting grounds are full of a terrifying array of arboreal creatures. The chance of random encounters within these forests increases by 10%.

*Resource*:: This hex contains valuable lumber, medicinal herbs, or plentiful sources of game meat. [Survival](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival) checks to get along in the wild gain a +5 bonus.

*Secret*:: A secret forest hex has thick mists or deep shadows that make fully exploring it a time-consuming prospect. Exploration time increases by 50%.
