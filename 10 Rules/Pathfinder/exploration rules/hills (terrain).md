# hill terrain

A hill is lower and less steep than a mountain. Hills are often transitional terrain between mountains and plains.

*Difficult*:: Full of short cliffs and jagged stones, a difficult hill hex requires extra caution to avoid dangerous falls. For the purposes of travel and exploration times, treat the partyâ€™s speed as one category slower on **Table: Travel Time (1 hex)** and **Table: Exploration Time (1 hex)**.

*Feature*:: The hex might be the site of a famous historical battle or the burial mound of long-dead chieftains. It provides a commanding view of the surrounding region and is useful as a waypoint. [Survival](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival) checks to avoid getting lost or to become un-lost in this hex gain a +1 bonus.

*Hunting Ground*:: The hex is cut with valleys and trenches that obscure predators from view. The chance of random encounters increases by 25%.

*Resource*:: The hex contains resources such as quality stone, coal, precious metals, or gems.

*Secret*:: Hidden caverns provide shelter and lairs for monsters. Locating these caverns requires a successful DC 10 [Perception](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception) or [Survival](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival) check. PCs who take shelter here suffer no effect from storms and similar hazards, but the chance of random encounters increases by 10%.
