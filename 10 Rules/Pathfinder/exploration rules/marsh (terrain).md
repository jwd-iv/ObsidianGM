# marsh terrain

Marshes, swamps, and bogs are challenging ground to traverse. [Survival](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival) check DCs to avoid getting lost increase by 1 in a marsh hex.

*Difficult*:: A difficult marsh hex is a deadly place, replete with quicksand, poisonous plants, and treacherous water. The DCs for [Survival](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival) checks to get along in the wild increase by 5. For the purposes of travel and exploration times, treat the party’s speed as one category slower on **Table: Travel Time (1 hex)** and **Table: Exploration Time (1 hex)**.

*Feature*:: The hex might be the location of a marsh creature’s den (such as a [hag](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/monstrous-humanoids/hag)), a sunken ruin, a large water causeway, or a shallow lake.

*Hunting Ground*:: Attacks in this hex are equally likely to come from underwater as from the surface. The chance of random encounters increases by 25%.

*Resource*:: Marsh resources primarily come in the form of medicinal plants and herbs.

*Secret*:: Unfortunate explorers died in the marsh and left behind all their gear. With a successful DC 25 [Survival](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival) check, the PCs can each salvage equipment worth 10 gp per character level.
