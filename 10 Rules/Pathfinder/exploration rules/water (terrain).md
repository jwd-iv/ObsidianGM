# water terrain

Whether a river, lake, or ocean, this type of hex is predominantly water. If the PCs lack swim speeds or boats, it is best to treat lakes and oceans as obstacles for the PCs to travel around rather than through. Treat the shores of the water hex as the adjacent terrain type.

*Difficult*:: Whitewater rapids, strong tides, or underwater vortexes mean this water is more challenging to cross. The [Swim](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/swim) DCs to cross these waters increase by 5.

*Feature*:: The hex is part of a large or well-known riverâ€™s course, or has a sturdy bridge that facilitates easy crossing.

*Hunting Ground*:: The hex might be home to predatory [aquatic](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Aquatic) creatures or opportunistic hunters waiting to strike prey that comes to drink. The chance of random encounters increases by 10%, or 25% if the PCs spend most of their time in the water.

*Resource*:: [Fish](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/fish), shellfish, and pearls are plentiful in the hex. In some situations, the benefit of this resource is the availability of fresh water rather than the contaminated water or salt water available in nearby hexes.

*Secret*:: The hex might contain an oasis, a connection to the [Plane of Water](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Plane-of-Water), or a spring with magical powers.
