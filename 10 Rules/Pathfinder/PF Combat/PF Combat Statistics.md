# PF Combat Statistics

This section summarizes the statistics that determine success in combat, then details how to use them.

## Attack Roll

An [attack roll](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attack-Roll) represents your attempt to strike your opponent on your turn in a round. When you make an [attack roll](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attack-Roll), you roll a d20 and add your [attack bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attack-Bonus). (Other modifiers may also apply to this roll.) If your result equals or beats the target’s [Armor Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Armor-Class), you hit and deal damage.

### Automatic Misses and Hits

A natural 1 (the d20 comes up 1) on an [attack roll](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attack-Roll) is always a miss. A natural 20 (the d20 comes up 20) is always a hit. A natural 20 is also a threat—a possible [critical hit](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Critical-Hits) (see the attack action).

## Attack Bonus

Your attack bonus with a **melee** weapon is:

**Base attack bonus + [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) modifier + size modifier**

Your attack bonus with a **ranged** weapon is:

**Base attack bonus + [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-) modifier + size modifier + range penalty**

Base Attack Bonus

**Source**: [d20srd.org](http://d20srd.org/)

A base attack bonus is an [attack roll](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attack-Roll) bonus derived from character class and level or creature type and [Hit Dice](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-) (or combination’s thereof). Base attack bonuses increase at different rates for different character classes and creature types. A second attack is gained when a base attack bonus reaches +6, a third with a base attack bonus of +11 or higher, and a fourth with a base attack bonus of +16 or higher. Base attack bonuses gained from different sources, such as when a character is a multiclass character, stack.

## Armor Class

Your Armor Class (AC) represents how hard it is for opponents to land a solid, damaging blow on you. It’s the [attack roll](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attack-Roll) result that an opponent needs to achieve to hit you.

Your AC is equal to the following:

**10 + [armor bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus) + [shield bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Shield-Bonus) + [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-) modifier + other modifiers**

Note that armor limits your [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-) bonus, so if you’re wearing [armor](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus), you might not be able to apply your whole [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-) bonus to your AC (see **Table: Armor and Shields**).

Sometimes you can’t use your [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-) bonus (if you have one). If you can’t react to a blow, you can’t use your [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-) bonus to AC. If you don’t have a [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-) bonus, your AC does not change.

### Other Modifiers

Many other factors modify your AC.

#### Enhancement Bonuses

Enhancement bonuses apply to your armor to increase the [armor bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus) it provides.

#### Deflection Bonus

Magical [deflection](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Bonus-Deflection-) effects ward off attacks and improve your AC.

#### Natural Armor

If your race has a tough hide, scales, or thick skin you receive a bonus to your AC.

#### Dodge Bonuses

Dodge bonuses represent actively avoiding blows. Any situation that denies you your [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-) bonus also denies you [dodge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Dodge-Bonus) bonuses. (Wearing [armor](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus), however, does not limit these bonuses the way it limits a [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-) bonus to AC.) Unlike most sorts of bonuses, [dodge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Dodge-Bonus) bonuses stack with each other.

#### Size Modifier

You receive a bonus or penalty to your AC based on your size. See **[Table: Size Modifiers](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#Table-Size-Modifiers)**.

| Size | Size Modifier |
| --- | --- |
| Colossal | –8 |
| Gargantuan | –4 |
| Huge | –2 |
| Large | –1 |
| Medium | +0 |
| Small | +1 |
| Tiny | +2 |
| Diminutive | +4 |
| Fine | +8 |
^Size-Modifiers

### Touch Attacks

Some attacks completely disregard [armor](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus), including shields and [natural armor](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Natural-Armor-Bonus)—the aggressor need only touch a foe for such an attack to take full effect. In these cases, the attacker makes a [touch attack](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Touch-Attacks) roll (either ranged or melee). When you are the target of a [touch attack](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Touch-Attacks), your AC doesn’t include any [armor bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus), [shield bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Shield-Bonus), or [natural armor bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Natural-Armor-Bonus). All other modifiers, such as your size modifier, [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-) modifier, and [deflection bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Deflection-Bonus) (if any) apply normally. Some creatures have the ability to make [incorporeal](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Incorporeal) touch attacks. These attacks bypass solid objects, such as armor and shields, by passing through them. [Incorporeal](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Incorporeal-Ex-) touch attacks work similarly to normal touch attacks except that they also ignore [cover](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Cover) bonuses. [Incorporeal](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Incorporeal-Ex-) touch attacks do not ignore armor bonuses granted by force effects, such as [mage armor](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/mage-armor) and [bracers of armor](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items#TOC-Bracers-of-Armor).

## Damage

If your attack succeeds, you deal damage. The type of weapon used determines the amount of damage you deal.

Damage reduces a target’s current [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points).

### Minimum Damage

If penalties reduce the damage result to less than 1, a hit still deals 1 point of [nonlethal damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage).

### Strength Bonus

When you hit with a melee or thrown weapon, including a sling, add your [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) modifier to the damage result. A [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) penalty, but not a bonus, applies on damage rolls made with a bow that is not a composite bow.

#### Off-Hand Weapon

When you deal damage with a weapon in your off hand, you add only 1/2 your [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) bonus. If you have a [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) penalty, the entire penalty applies.

#### Wielding a Weapon Two-Handed

When you deal damage with a weapon that you are wielding two-handed, you add 1-1/2 times your [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) bonus ([Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) penalties are not multiplied). You don’t get this higher [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) bonus, however, when using a light weapons with two hands.

FAQ

What kind of action is it to remove your hand from a two-handed weapon or re-grab it with both hands?

Both are free actions. For example, a wizard wielding a quarterstaff can let go of the weapon with one hand as a free action, cast a spell as a standard action, and grasp the weapon again with that hand as a free action; this means the wizard is still able to make attacks of opportunity with the weapon (which requires using two hands).

As with any free action, the GM may decide a reasonable limit to how many times per round you can release and re-grasp the weapon (one release and re-grasp per round is fair).

\[[Source](http://paizo.com/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1fm#v5748eaic9qda)\]

### Multiplying Damage

Sometimes you multiply damage by some factor, such as on a [critical hit](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Critical-Hits). Roll the damage (with all modifiers) multiple times and total the results.

**Note**: When you multiply damage more than once, each multiplier works off the original, unmultiplied damage. So if you are asked to double the damage twice, the end result is three times the normal damage.

*Exception*: Extra damage dice over and above a weapon’s normal damage are never multiplied.

#### Ability Damage

Certain creatures and magical effects can cause temporary or permanent [ability damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Ability-Damage-and-Drain-Ex-or-Su-) (a reduction to an ability score).

## Hit Points

When your hit point total reaches 0, you’re [disabled](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Disabled). When it reaches –1, you’re [dying](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dying). When it gets to a negative amount equal to your [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) score, you’re [dead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead). See Injury and Death, for more information.

## Attacks of Opportunity

Sometimes a combatant in a melee lets her guard down or takes a reckless action. In this case, combatants near her can take advantage of her lapse in defense to attack her for free. These free attacks are called [attacks of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity). See the [Attacks of Opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) diagram for an example of how they work.

### Threatened Squares

You threaten all squares into which you can make a melee attack, even when it is not your turn. Generally, that means everything in all squares adjacent to your space (including diagonally). An enemy that takes certain actions while in a [threatened](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Threatened-Squares) square provokes an [attack of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) from you. If you’re unarmed, you don’t normally threaten any squares and thus can’t make [attacks of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity).

#### Reach Weapons

Most creatures of Medium or smaller size have a reach of only 5 feet. This means that they can make melee attacks only against creatures up to 5 feet (1 square) away. However, Small and Medium creatures wielding reach weapons threaten more squares than a typical creature. In addition, most creatures larger than Medium have a natural reach of 10 feet or more.

### Provoking an Attack of Opportunity

Two kinds of actions can provoke [attacks of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity): moving out of a [threatened](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Threatened-Squares) square and performing certain actions within a [threatened](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Threatened-Squares) square.

#### Moving

Moving out of a [threatened](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Threatened-Squares) square usually provokes [attacks of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) from threatening opponents. There are two common methods of avoiding such an attack—the 5-foot step and the [withdraw action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Withdraw).

#### Performing a Distracting Act

Some actions, when performed in a [threatened](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Threatened-Squares) square, provoke [attacks of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) as you divert your attention from the battle. **[Table: Actions in Combat](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#Table-Actions-in-Combat)** notes many of the actions that provoke [attacks of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity).

Remember that even actions that normally provoke [attacks of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) may have exceptions to this rule.

### Making an Attack of Opportunity

An [attack of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) is a single melee attack, and most characters can only make one per round. You don’t have to make an [attack of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) if you don’t want to. You make your [attack of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) at your normal [attack bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attack-Bonus), even if you’ve already attacked in the round.

An [attack of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) “interrupts” the normal flow of actions in the round. If an [attack of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) is provoked, immediately resolve the [attack of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity), then continue with the next character’s turn (or complete the current turn, if the [attack of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) was provoked in the midst of a character’s turn).

#### Combat Reflexes and Additional Attacks of Opportunity

If you have the [Combat Reflexes](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/combat-reflexes-combat) feat, you can add your [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-) modifier to the number of [attacks of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) you can make in a round. This feat does not let you make more than one attack for a given opportunity, but if the same opponent provokes two [attacks of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) from you, you could make two separate [attacks of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) (since each one represents a different opportunity). Moving out of more than one square [threatened](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Threatened-Squares) by the same opponent in the same round doesn’t count as more than one opportunity for that opponent. All these attacks are at your full normal [attack bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attack-Bonus).

In this combat, the [fighter](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter) and the [sorcerer](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer) fight an [ogre](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/giants/ogre) and his [goblin](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/goblin) buddy.

**#1**: The [fighter](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter) can safely approach this way without provoking an [attack of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity), as he does not pass through a square [threatened](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Threatened-Squares) by the [ogre](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/giants/ogre) (who has 10 feet of reach) or the [goblin](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/goblin).

**#2**: If the [fighter](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter) approaches this way, he provokes two [attacks of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) since he passes through a square both creatures threaten.

**#3**: The [sorcerer](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer) moves away using a [withdraw action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Withdraw). The first square she leaves is not [threatened](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Threatened-Squares) as a result, and she can thus move away from the [goblin](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/goblin) safely, but when she leaves the second square, she provokes an [attack of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) from the [ogre](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/giants/ogre) (who has 10 feet of reach). She could instead limit her movement to a 5-foot step, as a [free action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Free-Actions), and not provoke any [attacks of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity).

## Speed

Your speed tells you how far you can move in a round and still do something, such as attack or cast a spell. Your speed depends mostly on your size and your armor.

[Dwarves](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/dwarf), [gnomes](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/gnome), and [halflings](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/halfling) have a speed of 20 feet (4 squares), or 15 feet (3 squares) when wearing medium or heavy armor (except for [dwarves](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/dwarf), who move 20 feet in any armor).

[Humans](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human), [elves](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/elf), [half-elves](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/half-elf), [half-orcs](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/half-orc), and most [humanoid](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid) monsters have a speed of 30 feet (6 squares), or 20 feet (4 squares) in medium or heavy armor.

If you use two move actions in a round (sometimes called a “double move” action), you can move up to double your speed. If you spend the entire round running, you can move up to quadruple your speed (or triple if you are in heavy armor).

## Saving Throws

Generally, when you are subject to an unusual or magical attack, you get a saving throw to avoid or reduce the effect. Like an [attack roll](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attack-Roll), a saving throw is a d20 roll plus a bonus based on your class and level (see [Classes](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes)), and an associated ability score.

Your saving throw modifier is:

**Base save bonus + ability modifier**

### Saving Throw Types

The three different kinds of saving throws are Fortitude, Reflex, and Will:

#### Fortitude

These saves measure your ability to stand up to physical punishment or attacks against your vitality and health. Apply your [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) modifier to your [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#TOC-Fortitude) saving throws.

#### Reflex

These saves test your ability to dodge area attacks and unexpected situations. Apply your [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-) modifier to your Reflex saving throws.

#### Will

These saves reflect your resistance to mental influence as well as many magical effects. Apply your [Wisdom](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-) modifier to your Will saving throws.

### Saving Throw Difficulty Class

The [DC](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Difficulty-Class-DC-) for a save is determined by the attack itself.

### Automatic Failures and Successes

A natural 1 (the d20 comes up 1) on a saving throw is always a failure (and may cause damage to exposed items; see [**Items Surviving after a Saving Throw**](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#Table-Items-Affected-by-Magical-Attacks)). A natural 20 (the d20 comes up 20) is always a success.
