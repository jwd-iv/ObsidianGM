# Combat

Combat is cyclical; everybody acts in turn in a regular cycle of rounds. Combat follows this sequence:

1.  When combat begins, all combatants roll [initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Initiative).
2.  Determine which characters are aware of their opponents. These characters can act during a [surprise](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Surprise) round. If all the characters are aware of their opponents, proceed with normal rounds. See the [surprise](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Surprise) section for more information.
3.  After the surprise round (if any), all combatants are ready to begin the first normal round of combat.
4.  Combatants act in [initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Initiative) order (highest to lowest).
5.  When everyone has had a turn, the next round begins with the combatant with the highest [initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Initiative), and steps 3 and 4 repeat until combat ends.

## The Combat Round

Each round represents 6 seconds in the game world; there are 10 rounds in a minute of combat. A round normally allows each character involved in a combat situation to act.

Each round’s activity begins with the character with the highest [initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Initiative) result and then proceeds in order. When a character’s turn comes up in the [initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Initiative) sequence, that character performs his entire round’s worth of actions. (For exceptions, see [Attacks of Opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) and Special [Initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Initiative) Actions.)

When the rules refer to a “full round”, they usually mean a span of time from a particular [initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Initiative) count in one round to the same [initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Initiative) count in the next round. Effects that last a certain number of rounds end just before the same [initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Initiative) count that they began on.

## Initiative

### Initiative Checks

At the start of a battle, each combatant makes an initiative check. An initiative check is a [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-) check. Each character applies his or her [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-) modifier to the roll, as well as other modifiers from feats, spells, and other effects. Characters act in order, counting down from the highest result to the lowest. In every round that follows, the characters act in the same order (unless a character takes an action that results in his or her [initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Initiative) changing; see Special [Initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Initiative) Actions).

If two or more combatants have the same initiative check result, the combatants who are tied act in order of total initiative modifier (highest first). If there is still a tie, the tied characters should roll to determine which one of them goes before the other.

#### Flat-Footed

At the start of a battle, before you have had a chance to act (specifically, before your first regular turn in the [initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Initiative) order), you are [flat-footed](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Flat-Footed). You can’t use your [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-) bonus to AC (if any) while [flat-footed](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Flat-Footed). Barbarians and [rogues](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue) of high enough level have the [uncanny dodge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Uncanny-Dodge-Ex-) extraordinary ability, which means that they cannot be caught [flat-footed](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Flat-Footed). Characters with [uncanny dodge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Uncanny-Dodge-Ex-) retain their [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-) bonus to their AC and can make [attacks of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) before they have acted in the first round of combat. A [flat-footed](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Flat-Footed) character can’t make [attacks of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity), unless he has the [Combat Reflexes](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/combat-reflexes-combat) feat.

#### Inaction

Even if you can’t take actions, you retain your [initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Initiative) score for the duration of the encounter.

## Surprise

When a combat starts, if you are not aware of your opponents and they are aware of you, you’re surprised.

### Determining Awareness

Sometimes all the combatants on a side are aware of their opponents, sometimes none are, and sometimes only some of them are. Sometimes a few combatants on each side are aware and the other combatants on each side are unaware.

Determining awareness may call for [Perception](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception) checks or other checks.

#### The Surprise Round

If some but not all of the combatants are aware of their opponents, a [surprise](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Surprise) round happens before regular rounds begin. In [initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Initiative) order (highest to lowest), combatants who started the battle aware of their opponents each take a standard or [move action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Move-Actions) during the [surprise](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Surprise) round. You can also take free actions during the [surprise](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Surprise) round. If no one or everyone is surprised, no [surprise](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Surprise) round occurs.

#### Unaware Combatants

Combatants who are unaware at the start of battle don’t get to act in the [surprise](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Surprise) round. Unaware combatants are [flat-footed](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Flat-Footed) because they have not acted yet, so they lose any [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-) bonus to AC.

#### Initiative Tips

**Source**: [PRG:GMG](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/160125217X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=160125217X&linkCode=as2&tag=httpwwwd20pfs-20&linkId=WV7KU5OKKXXVBXUH)

Keeping track of whose turn it is during combat can be complicated. Combat is the most complex part of the game, and the easiest place for a session to bog down. Anything that helps speed up combat means everyone gets more done and has more opportunities for fun. The simplest way of handling this is to record each PC and monster name on a card; when combat starts, write each creature’s [initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Initiative) score on its card and sort them into the [initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Initiative) order. Thereafter, determining who’s next to act is just a matter of cycling through the cards. Ambitious GMs can add info to the monsters’ cards, such as [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points), special attack DCs, and other information relating to what the monster can do on its turn. (This can also be a useful place to record PC [Perception](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception) checks and saves, so that you can make secret checks without asking players for their statistics.) Especially detailed initiative cards that resemble character sheets, with room for all of a creature’s relevant data, can remove the need to refer to a book.

Another method is using a larger surface like a cork board, marker board, or dry-erase board to track PC and monster [initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Initiative) and status. If positioned so the players can see it as well, this also lets them know when their turns are coming up so they can plan ahead. A combat pad is a handy page-sized version of this—a magnetic dry/wet-erase board with dry/wet-erase magnets to indicate PCs and monsters. While it fulfills the same function as a pad of paper, the creature magnets make it easy to adjust [initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Initiative) order for [readied](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Ready) and delayed actions, and saves the [GM](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Game-Master-GM-) the time and effort of rewriting all the PC names for every combat.

Speeding Up Combat Ideas

-   *Display the Combat Order*: If a PC knows what the current tick of the initiative clock is and knows when the participants get to act, he knows when his turn is coming up and can plan for what he wants to do. This means instead of hemming and hawing for a minute at the start of his turn, he can hem and haw during the previous player’s turn and be ready when it’s his turn. It also lets the PCs coordinate their actions together—while stingy GMs may see this as cheating or metagaming, remember that the turn-based [initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Initiative) system is just a tool to simulate real-time combat in a way that doesn’t take forever, and in a real combat, people on the same side wouldn’t be locked into only acting in a specific order without awareness of each others’ intent.
-   *Five Second Rule*: If the players can see who’s up next in the [initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Initiative) order, they have no excuse for not knowing what’s going on or what their characters want to do. If a PC’s turn comes up and the player takes more than a few seconds to announce his character’s action, skip him as if he had chosen to [delay](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Delay) his action and move on to the next creature’s turn—after all, combat is hectic, and sometimes in the thick of battle you need a second or two to focus. This doesn’t cost the PC any actions, so they’re only penalized their position in the initiative, and it hopefully encourages them to pay more attention to what’s happening. Note that speeding up combat in general means players get to act more often and are less likely to get distracted between their turns, so the rest of these tips should make this one less necessary. Note also that you should let players know in advance that you’re going to do this, as springing it on them unexpectedly can seem vindictive.
-   *Plan and Combine Dice Rolls*: Rolling attacks and damage separately takes twice as long as rolling them all together. Save time by coordinating your [attack roll](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attack-Roll) dice with your damage roll dice so you can roll them at the same time, and encourage players to do the same. For example, if the PCs are fighting four [orcs](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/orcs/orc), each with a falchion, get four different-colored d20s and a pair of matching d4s for each orc, then roll all 12 dice at the same time; if the red d20 and green d20 are hits, you know to look at the red d4s and the green d4s and ignore the blue d4s and purple d4s. If the PCs are fighting a [dire lion](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/cat-great/lion/dire-lion), you can color-coordinate the bite’s d8 die with one d20 and two claw d6 dice with two other d20s, and roll all the dice at once. Be aware, however, that while rolling attack and damage at the same time is always a good idea, rolling all your attacks at once can be problematic if you (or your players) want to split the attacks between multiple opponents—if you don’t carefully assign each attack before you roll, it’s tempting to say that two of those three attacks which would have missed the main villain were actually directed at his weaker henchmen, whether or not that was your original intention.


## Big and Little Creatures In Combat

Creatures smaller than Small or larger than Medium have special rules relating to position.

| Creature Size | Space | Natural Reach\* |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fine | 1/2 ft. | 0 |
| Diminutive | 1 ft. | 0 |
| Tiny | 2-1/2 ft. | 0 |
| Small | 5 ft. | 5 ft. |
| Medium | 5 ft. | 5 ft. |
| Large (tall) | 10 ft. | 10 ft. |
| Large (long) | 10 ft. | 5 ft. |
| Huge (tall) | 15 ft. | 15 ft. |
| Huge (long) | 15 ft. | 10 ft. |
| Gargantuan (tall) | 20 ft. | 20 ft. |
| Gargantuan (long) | 20 ft. | 15 ft. |
| Colossal (tall) | 30 ft. | 30 ft. |
| Colossal (long) | 30 ft. | 20 ft. |
| \* These values are typical for creatures of the indicated size. Some exceptions exist. |
^Creature-Size-and-Scale

### Tiny, Diminutive, and Fine Creatures

Very small creatures take up less than 1 square of space. This means that more than one such creature can fit into a single square. A Tiny creature typically occupies a space only 2-1/2 feet across, so four can fit into a single square. 25 Diminutive creatures or 100 Fine creatures can fit into a single square. Creatures that take up less than 1 square of space typically have a natural reach of 0 feet, meaning they can’t reach into adjacent squares. They must enter an opponent’s square to attack in melee. This provokes an [attack of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) from the opponent. You can attack into your own square if you need to, so you can attack such creatures normally. Since they have no natural reach, they do not threaten the squares around them. You can move past them without provoking [attacks of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity). They also can’t [flank](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Flanking) an enemy.

### Large, Huge, Gargantuan, and Colossal Creatures

Very large creatures take up more than 1 square.

Creatures that take up more than 1 square typically have a natural reach of 10 feet or more, meaning that they can reach targets even if they aren’t in adjacent squares.

Unlike when someone uses a reach weapon, a creature with greater than normal natural reach (more than 5 feet) still threatens squares adjacent to it. A creature with greater than normal natural reach usually gets an [attack of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) against you if you approach it, because you must enter and move within the range of its reach before you can attack it. This [attack of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) is not provoked if you take a 5-foot step.

Large or larger creatures using reach weapons can strike up to double their natural reach but can’t strike at their natural reach or less.
