# Injury and Death

Massive Damage (Optional Rule)

If you ever sustain a single attack that deals an amount of damage equal to half your total [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points) (minimum 50 points of damage) or more and it doesn’t kill you outright, you must make a [DC](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Difficulty-Class-DC-) 15 [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Fortitude) save. If this [saving throw](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Saving-Throws) fails, you die regardless of your current [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points). If you take half your total [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points) or more in damage from multiple attacks, no one of which dealt more than half your total [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points) (minimum 50), the massive damage rule does not apply.

Scars and Wounds (Optional Rule)

**Source** S&SPG

This optional rules system gives GMs a way to assign scars and major wounds to PCs. Before implementing this system, consider these rules carefully. Major wounds can have major effects upon play, and some groups may not appreciate such debilitations, preferring the threat of death and an unscarred resurrection over a thematic crippling. These rules are a variation on the optional massive damage rule.

Whenever a character takes damage equivalent to massive damage, he must make a successful DC 15 [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Fortitude) save or be reduced to –1 [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points) and gain a permanent debilitating scar or handicap. These effects are randomly determined by rolling 1d20 on the table below. Effects are permanent and cumulative, though the GM should reroll results that seem too crippling or don’t make sense—such as a character losing a hand two or three times. The [regenerate](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/regenerate) spell heals scars and restores lost limbs, removing both positive and negative effects.

| d20 | Battle Scar or Amputation |
| --- | --- |
| 1–5 | Minor scar—interesting but otherwise cosmetic |
| 6–8 | Moderate scar—cut on face (+1 bonus on [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-)\-based skill checks for first scar only, consider subsequent cuts as a major scar) |
| 9–10 | Major scar—severe cut on face (–1 penalty on [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-)\-based skill checks\*\*) |
| 11–14 | Loss of finger (for every 3 fingers lost, –1 [Dex](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-)) |
| 15–16 | Impressive wound (–1 [Con](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-)) |
| 17 | Loss of eye (–4 penalty on all sight-based [Perception](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception) checks) |
| 18 | Loss of leg (speed reduced to half, cannot [charge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Charge)) |
| 19 | Loss of hand (cannot use two-handed items\*) |
| 20 | Loss of arm (–1 [Str](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-), cannot use two-handed items\*) |
^Scars-and-Wounds

\* Losing a single hand or arm does not affect a spellcaster’s ability to cast spells with somatic [components](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components).  
\*\* At the GM’s discretion, characters with major scars may also be granted a +1 bonus on all [Bluff](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/bluff), [Diplomacy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/diplomacy), or [Intimidate](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/intimidate) checks against other pirates, as the scars of battle are much admired by pirates.

Your [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points) measure how hard you are to kill. No matter how many [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points) you lose, your character isn’t hindered in any way until your [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points) drop to 0 or lower.

## Loss of Hit Points

The most common way that your character gets hurt is to take lethal damage and lose [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points).

### What Hit Points Represent

Hit points mean two things in the game world: the ability to take physical punishment and keep going, and the ability to turn a serious blow into a less serious one.

### Effects of Hit Point Damage

Damage doesn’t slow you down until your current [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points) reach 0 or lower. At 0 [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points), you’re [disabled](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#TOC-Disabled).

If your hit point total is negative, but not equal to or greater than your [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) score, you are [unconscious](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#TOC-Unconscious) and [dying](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#TOC-Dying).

When your negative hit point total is equal to your [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-), you’re [dead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#TOC-Dead).

### Disabled (0 Hit Points)

When your current hit point total drops to exactly 0, you are [disabled](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#TOC-Disabled).

You gain the [staggered](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered) condition and can only take a single move or [standard action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Standard-Actions) each turn (but not both, nor can you take full-round actions). You can take move actions without further injuring yourself, but if you perform any [standard action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Standard-Actions) (or any other strenuous action) you take 1 point of damage after completing the act. Unless your activity increased your [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points), you are now at –1 [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points) and [dying](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dying).

Healing that raises your [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points) above 0 makes you fully functional again, just as if you’d never been reduced to 0 or fewer [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points).

You can also become [disabled](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#TOC-Disabled) when recovering from [dying](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dying). In this case, it’s a step toward recovery, and you can have fewer than 0 [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points) (see Stable Characters and Recovery).

### Dying (Negative Hit Points)

If your hit point total is negative, but not equal to or greater than your [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) score, you’re [dying](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dying).

A [dying](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dying) character immediately falls [unconscious](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious) and can take no actions.

A [dying](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dying) character loses 1 hit point every round. This continues until the character dies or becomes [stable](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stable).

### Dead

When your character’s current [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points) drop to a negative amount equal to his [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) score or lower, or if he succumbs to massive damage, he’s [dead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead). A character can also die from taking [ability damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Ability-Damage-and-Drain-Ex-or-Su-) or suffering an [ability drain](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Ability-Damage-and-Drain-Ex-or-Su-) that reduces his [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) score to 0 (see Special Abilities).

Certain types of powerful magic, such as [raise dead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/raise-dead) and [resurrection](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/resurrection), can restore life to a [dead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead) character.

## Stable Characters and Recovery

On the character’s next turn, after being reduced to negative [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points) (but not [dead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead)), and on all subsequent turns, the character must make a [DC](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Difficulty-Class-DC-) 10 [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) check to become [stable](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stable). The character takes a penalty on this roll equal to his negative hit point total. A character that is [stable](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stable) does not need to make this check. A natural 20 on this check is an automatic success. If the character fails this check, he loses 1 hit point. An [unconscious](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious) or [dying](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dying) character cannot use any special action that changes the [initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Initiative) count on which his action occurs.

Characters taking continuous damage, such as from an [acid arrow](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/acid-arrow) or a [bleed](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/bleed) effect, automatically fail all [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) checks made to [stabilize](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/stabilize). Such characters lose 1 hit point per round in addition to the continuous damage.

You can keep a [dying](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dying) character from losing any more [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points) and make him [stable](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stable) with a [DC](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Difficulty-Class-DC-) 15 [Heal](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/heal) check.

If any sort of healing cures the [dying](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dying) character of even 1 point of damage, he becomes [stable](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stable) and stops losing [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points).

Healing that raises the [dying](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dying) character’s [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points) to 0 makes him conscious and [disabled](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#TOC-Disabled). [Healing](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Healing) that raises his [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points) to 1 or more makes him fully functional again, just as if he’d never been reduced to 0 or lower. A spellcaster retains the spellcasting capability she had before dropping below 0 [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points).

A [stable](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stable) character who has been tended by a healer or who has been magically healed eventually regains consciousness and recovers [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points) naturally. If the character has no one to tend him, however, his life is still in danger, and he may yet slip away.

### Recovering with Help

One hour after a tended, [dying](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dying) character becomes [stable](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stable), the character must make a [DC](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Difficulty-Class-DC-) 10 [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) check to become conscious. The character takes a penalty on this roll equal to his negative hit point total. Conscious characters with negative hit point totals are treated as [disabled](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Disabled) characters. If the character remains [unconscious](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious), he receives another check every hour to regain consciousness. A natural 20 on this check is an automatic success. Even if [unconscious](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious), the character recovers [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points) naturally. He automatically regains consciousness when his [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points) rise to 1 or higher.

### Recovering without Help

A severely wounded character left alone usually dies. He has a small chance of recovering on his own. Treat such characters as those attempting to recover with help, but every failed [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) check to regain consciousness results in the loss of 1 hit point. An unaided character does not recover [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points) naturally. Once conscious, the character can make a [DC](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Difficulty-Class-DC-) 10 [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) check once per day, after resting for 8 hours, to begin recovering [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points) naturally. The character takes a penalty on this roll equal to his negative hit point total. Failing this check causes the character to lose 1 hit point, but this does not cause the character to become [unconscious](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious). Once a character makes this check, he continues to heal naturally and is no longer in danger of losing [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points) naturally.

## Healing

After taking damage, you can recover [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points) through natural healing or through magical healing. In any case, you can’t regain [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points) past your full normal hit point total.

### Natural Healing

With a full night’s rest (8 hours of sleep or more), you recover 1 hit point per character level. Any significant interruption during your rest prevents you from healing that night.

If you undergo complete bed rest for an entire day and night, you recover twice your character level in [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points).

### Magical Healing

Various abilities and spells can restore [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points).

### Healing Limits

You can never recover more [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points) than you lost. Magical healing won’t raise your current [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points) higher than your full normal hit point total.

### Healing Ability Damage

Temporary [ability damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Ability-Damage-and-Drain-Ex-or-Su-) returns at the rate of 1 point per night of rest (8 hours) for each affected ability score. Complete bed rest restores 2 points per day (24 hours) for each affected ability score.

## Temporary Hit Points\*

FAQ

Do temporary hit point from the same source stack?

No. Generally, effects do not stack if they are from the same source (*Core Rulebook* page 208, Combining Magical Effects). Although temporary hit points are not a “bonus,” the principle still applies.

This prevents a creature with energy drain (which grants the creature 5 temporary hit points when used) from draining an entire village of 100 people in order to gain 500 temporary hit points before the PCs arrive to fight it.

Temporary hit points from different sources (such as an *aid* spell, a use of energy drain, and a *vampiric touch* spell) still stack with each other.

\[[Source](http://paizo.com/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1fm#v5748eaic9r42)\]

Certain effects give a character [temporary hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points). These [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points) are in addition to the character’s current hit point total and any damage taken by the character is subtracted from these [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points) first. Any damage in excess of a character’s [temporary hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points) is applied to his current [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points) as normal. If the effect that grants the [temporary hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points) ends or is dispelled, any remaining [temporary hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points) go away. The damage they sustained is not transferred to the character’s current [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points).

When [temporary hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points) are lost, they cannot be restored as real [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points) can be, even by magic.

### Increases in Constitution Score and Current Hit Points

An increase in a character’s [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) score, even a temporary one, can give her more [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points) (an effective hit point increase), but these are not [temporary hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points). They can be restored, and they are not lost first as [temporary hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points) are.

## Nonlethal Damage

Nonlethal damage represents harm to a character that is not life-threatening. Unlike normal damage, [nonlethal damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage) is healed quickly with rest.

### Dealing Nonlethal Damage

Certain attacks deal [nonlethal damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage). Other effects, such as heat or being [exhausted](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Exhausted), also deal [nonlethal damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage). When you take [nonlethal damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage), keep a running total of how much you’ve accumulated. Do not deduct the [nonlethal damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage) number from your current [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points). It is not “real” damage. Instead, when your [nonlethal damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage) equals your current [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points), you’re [staggered](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered) (see below), and when it exceeds your current [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points), you fall [unconscious](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious).

**Nonlethal Damage with a Weapon that Deals Lethal Damage**

You can use a melee weapon that deals lethal damage to deal [nonlethal damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage) instead, but you take a –4 penalty on your [attack roll](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attack-Roll).

**Lethal Damage with a Weapon that Deals Nonlethal Damage**

You can use a weapon that deals [nonlethal damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage), including an unarmed strike, to deal lethal damage instead, but you take a –4 penalty on your [attack roll](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Attack-Roll).

### Staggered and Unconscious

When your [nonlethal damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage) equals your current [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points), you’re [staggered](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered). You can only take a [standard action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Standard-Actions) or a [move action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Move-Actions) in each round (in addition to free, immediate, and [swift actions](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Swift-Actions)). You cease being [staggered](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered) when your current [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points) once again exceed your [nonlethal damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage).

When your [nonlethal damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage) exceeds your current [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points), you fall [unconscious](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious). While [unconscious](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious), you are [helpless](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless).

Spellcasters who fall [unconscious](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious) retain any spellcasting ability they had before going [unconscious](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious).

If a creature’s [nonlethal damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage) is equal to his total maximum [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points) (not his current [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Hit-Points)), all further [nonlethal damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage) is treated as lethal damage. This does not apply to creatures with [regeneration](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Regeneration-Ex-). Such creatures simply accrue additional [nonlethal damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage), increasing the amount of time they remain [unconscious](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious).

### Healing Nonlethal Damage

You heal [nonlethal damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage) at the rate of 1 hit point per hour per character level. When a spell or ability cures hit point damage, it also removes an equal amount of [nonlethal damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage).
