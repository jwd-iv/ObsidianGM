^Dark-Bog-Random-Encounters

## Other Encounters

- **Bandit/Brigand**: Encounters with bandits and brigands in daylight hours are usually non-hostile, as the criminals prefer to strike at night. The bandits will perhaps be noticed watching the party as a possible future prospect. Nighttime encounters are usually hostile and will typically consist of 3-12 bandits with 1 or more leaders.
- **Beggar**: Beggar encounters usually consist of 1-2 person(s). They may be young or old; maimed, diseased, or perfectly healthy) beseeching alms. Often a beggar is actually a thief and just as often beggars know information of interest to the PCs, but payment of some sort must be made. Any gratuity or gift given to a beggar is very likely to attract the attention of other beggars nearby.
- **Caravan**: A caravan trading with locals or passing on to more profitable lands. Such caravans are often well guarded and suspicious of traders. These merchants brave the dangers of the road on their way to distant markets. This band includes porters and traders and are guarded by `dice: 2d4` 2nd-level [human](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human) warriors. They are generally fairly well prepared to fend off small bands of common bandits or other minor dangers. Although most of their goods are basic equipment and fine but mundane textiles (usually valued around 1,200 gp), there is a 20% chance that the merchants have for sale `dice: 1d4` random minor magic items.
- **City Guard/Watch**: While many are upstanding peacekeepers, others are corrupt and likely up to some mischief or criminal venture. Such encounters usually consist of 2-16 soldiers in the employ of the city or in a police function and one or two of which will be a captain or commander (2 if more than 8 guards, 3 if more than 12). Leaders are of 2nd to 5th level [fighters](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter).
- **City Official**: Such encounters will are with some minor bureaucrat such as a tax collector, customs officer, or magistrate. Rarely, such encounters are with a major official, such as prominent steward, alderman, justice, chamberlain, or major magistrate. Major officials are always accompanied by 2-8 guards (1st level [fighters](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter) and one [fighter](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter) 2nd to 5th level).
- **Con-Artist**: A scoundrel selling fake magic items, an honest-looking “father” hoping to buy back his enslaved, fictitious daughter, or a gambler running a fixed game targets the PCs, seeking to trick them out of some gold.
- **Curfew Breakers**: Rowdy citizens occasionally carouse about the city after dark. Such encounters might be with tradesmen or merchants drunk on their way home, or foolish brash youths, or any other everyday citizen out and about.
- **Drunk**: A raucously singing group of stumbling pirates, an angry wino looking for a brawl, or a jovial but down-on-his-luck drunk just looking for a free drink stumbles into the PCs. Encounters with drunks are typically with 1-4 tipsy revelers or wine-sodden bums (50% chance for either). In the former case the type of character found drunk should be diced for: When an encounter with a drunk occurs, reaction for the latter will dictate what is said to the party. The drunk character(s) will become sober on a roll of 10% or less (out of 100%) if [threatened](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Threatened-Squares), check each turn or melee round.
- **Eccentric Local**: Eccentric locals might be rambling beggars or even zealous doomsayers.
- **Gang**: Whether men whose desperation has led them to alleyway banditry or members of a local thieves’ guild, groups of dangerous residents wander the streets unchallenged. Such an encounter might involve young toughs up to no good, thugs shaking down their neighbors, or even heavies in the employ of a local crimelord. These encounters can range in CR from very low—requiring only a little sword rattling to disperse some skittish vandals—to very high, depending on your needs and situation.
- **Gentleman**: Encounters are with a foppish dandy and 1-4 sycophants 40% of the time, a gentlewoman 20% of the time, and 40% of the time well-dressed [fighter](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter)-types of 7th to 10th level (d4 + 6) with 1-4 friends of the same abilities. Any rude remarks will give offense, of course. Fops seek revenge by causing trouble for the party with officials, gentlewomen will send a champion, [fighters](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter) will challenge the offenders.
- **Goodwife**: Encounters are with a single woman, often indistinguishable from any other type of female (such as a magic-user, harlot, etc.). Any offensive treatment or seeming threat will be likely to cause the woman to scream for help, accusing the offending party of any number of crimes, i.e. assault, rape, theft, or murder. 20% of goodwives know interesting gossip.
- **Leper/Plague Victim(s)**: One (or several) contagious and obviously very ill people. Most plague victims are simple 1st-level commoners. An outcast begging for alms, a plague victim spreading his terrible illness, or a leper hiding in the shadows, this encounter tests PCs’ charity and [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) saves.
- **Laborer**: encounters are with a group of 3-12 nondescript persons loitering or on their way to or from work. These fellows will be rough customers in a brawl. There is a 10% chance for each to be a levy in the city watch, with commensurate friends and knowledge.
- **Merchant**: A fast-talking vendor or an excessively persistent foreign haggler latches onto a PC, eager to sell his wares and unwilling to take no for an answer. At night there will be 2-8 mercenary guards with the merchant(s) if the encounter is in a dangerous sector. A merchant occasionally has useful knowledge for a price.
- **Noble**: Encounters with nobleman usually include a number of retainers. A noble will typically have `dice: 1d4` 1st-2nd level warrior guards and 1-2 misc. servants. A noblewoman will almost always be encountered riding in a sedan chair, accompanied by carriers and linkboys (at night). Noblemen are often mistaken for city officials or rich merchants; noblewomen can likewise be mistaken for a courtesan or procuress. Any insult will be taken seriously.
- **Nomads**: While some nomads are peaceful hunters, others survive by preying upon travelers. In either case, these natives are suspicious of outsiders. Should the PCs encounter a band of nomads, there is a 35% chance they are hostile. While more peaceful nomads are typically comprised of `dice: 2d10` 2nd-level warriors and a 2nd-level [rogue](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue) leader, raiders often travel in bands of `dice: 2d4` 2nd-level [rogues](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue).
- **Pickpocket**: A single thief, criminal team, or gang of waifs attempts to nab something off a PC while he’s distracted. Although catching the cutpurse might save the PC a few gold or a favorite item, it’s possible the thief needs the object much more than the PC, or is actually leading them into a trap where they plan to claim more than a few trinkets. An encounter with `dice: 1d6` CR 1/2 thieves is a CR 2 encounter, while an encounter with `dice: 1d10` CR 1/2 thieves is a CR 3 encounter.
- **Pilgrim**: Pilgrim encounters are typically with 3-12 persons upon a journey to some religious or other important destination. For every 4 pilgrims there will be 1 of unusual type ([cleric](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric), [fighter](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter), etc.). As pilgrims are often nondescript, they are often mistaken for other groups (bandits, laborers, etc.).
- **Pirates**: A single rowdy scallywag or whole crew on shore leave notice the PCs. Whether they’re looking for a brawl, a drinking buddy, or a new addition to their crew is up to the GM. While encountering a raucous gang of pirates might play out little differently than a battle with a gang of thugs, things could totally change when the sea rats’ captain shows up with the rest of his cut-throat crew.
- **Press Gang**: A gang of burly sailors decides the PCs would make perfect additions to their captain’s crew and attempts to drag one or more of them back to their ship by force. Should a lone PC get caught unaware, it’s entirely possible that he wakes up in the brig or, even worse, on a ship already put out to sea!
- **Prostitute**: One of the PCs catches a streetwalker’s eye. Such encounters can sometimes be difficult to recognize for what it actually is. In addition to the offering of the usual fare, prostitutes often know other valuable information, but also almost as likely to make up information to sell, and in other cases either is personally, or is working with, a thief.
- **Slave Traders**: A hardy traveler (or travelers) with a cage-wagon filled with slaves bound for market. The trader is usually accompanied by a few ruffians hired to watch the cargo.
- **Slaves (Escaped)**: These slaves have recently escaped from their oppressors and are timid and frightened. They attempt to avoid contact with PCs unless cornered but if so ask for help. If desired, roll again on the encounter table to see if either the slave traders they have escaped from are nearby, or perhaps a random other monster was preparing to attack them.
- **Stray Animal**: One (or several- depending on group size) feral animals (dogs, cats, etc.) are scavenging in the area.
- **Thugs**: A lone tough or group of ruffians attempts to bully, shake down, or even kidnap a PC. Only brute force (or a strong showing of such) can drive the brute(s) off.
- **Tradesman**: Tradesman consist of coopers, potters, seamstresses, smiths, and the like. This tradesman is on his way to or from work. Tradesman are typically valued members of a settlement and usually on very good terms with city guards and watch.
- **Tribesfolk**: Tribesfolk may be cannibals, peaceful villagers, or simple wandering tribal warriors.
